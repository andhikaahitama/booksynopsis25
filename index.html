Antonia Fraser was made CBE in 1999, and awarded the Norton Medlicott Medal by the Historical Association in 2000. She is married to the playwright Harold Pinter and lives in London.In 1066 William the Conqueror captured the English throne, and since that time 39 kings and queens have reigned over the British dominions. Their lives, alliances, whims, delusions, and intrigues have had an incalculable influence on the culture, politics, and very boundaries of the entire world. From the Plantagenets to the Tudors, from the Hanovers to the Winsors, Wanda McCaddon delivers these short, straightforward biographies with proper English pride, deference, and oftentimes, a sly sense of irony. The names and dates come fast and furiously, but here are a few facts: Over half of France was in England's possession during the reign of Henry II. Richard III was the last English monarch to die on the battlefield. And, as a 19-year-old princess, Queen Elizabeth II joined the Auxiliary Transport Service as a mechanic in the final days of WWII.

Those who have most conspicuously upheld Adams's fame have, at the same time, virtually ignored his service in the White House. Critics, on the other hand, have described his administration as a failure, founded upon "bargain and corruption" and marked by exclusion of the United States from the British West Indian trade, the ineffectiveness of its efforts to promote strong Pan-American relationships, and the enactment of the "tariff of abominations." Some analysts have even argued that it generated the sectionalism which terminated the "Era of Good Feelings."<br><br>Mary Hargreaves contends, instead, that the basic effort of Adams's presidency was to harmonize divergent sectional interests. To ignore the Adams administration's commitment to nationalism, she argues, is to overlook a fundamental stage in the establishment of the federal government as guardian of the general interest.<br><br>The volume contains new information on the development of United States commercial policy, the nation's early relationships with Latin America, and difficulties of local and regional adjustment to the growth of the national economy. It will be of keen interest to all students of the economic and political history of the early national period.</p><p>Mary W. M. Hargreaves is professor emerita of history at the University of Kentucky.Adams was one of America's greatest statesmen, yet one of its least effective presidents. Hargreaves explains why in a solid and dispassionate account of his administration. A minority president, Adams was beset by overwhelming political obstructionism. Sectional, local, and personal partisanship destroyed the national perspectives of his ``American system.'' Diplomatically, his efforts to expand American commerce were stymied. Adams was temperamentally and culturally unsuited to popular politics and became a victim of them in 1828. Yet he expanded the federal role in promoting internal improvements, and he presided over four years of sustained economic growth. Excellent documentation and comprehensive analysis will make this book the standard study, definitive in its treatment of public policy. Harry W.

Dubbed "The Powder Puff Derby" by humorist Will Rogers, who covered the race, the competition was aggressive and dangerous. <br><br>A thrilling narrative, The Powder Puff Derby of 1929 tells the story of the first major female airplane race, whose contestants included Amelia Earhart, the most famous female pilot of her time. Many of the women flew in open cockpits, with no air controllers to help them and often only primitive airports to land on. Yet by facing the hazards with skill and determination, the racers thrilled the nation and pioneered a new future and respect for female aviators. <br><br>The Powder Puff Derby of 1929 tells the stories of these first female pilots, gutsy and colorful adventurers who flew in air circuses, set altitude and speed records and fought for the right to become part of the male-dominated world of aviation. The book also includes various artifacts of the groundbreaking race, including priceless, never-before-published black and white photos, as well as Air Force maps of the terrain over which the women flew. <br><br>An inspiring story of confidence and persistence, The Powder Puff Derby of 1929 captures a defining moment in the history of aviation and women's rights.<br></p><p>In the summer of 1961 while working her way through the University of Oklahoma on the faculty teaching flying, Gene Nora (pronounced Janora) participated in a female astronaut research program at the Lovelace Clinic in Albuquerque. Though Gene Nora was among the thirteen women (light-heartedly tagged the "Mercury 13") who passed the physical exams, further testing was cancelled. <br>In 1962, she flew as a sales demonstration pilot for the Beech Aircraft factory in Wichita, Kansas. Initially, she flew one of the Three Musketeers, flying formation across forty-eight states in ninety days as a promotional event to introduce the new Beech Musketeer. The job evolved into additional flight ratings and flying the entire Beech line. She met her husband Bob at Beech, and they eventually migrated west to become a Beech dealer in Boise, Idaho, Gene Nora operating their flight school. <br>Gene Nora has remained active in aviation, serving on the Boise Airport Commission; as President of the Ninety-Nines; on various community boards; participating in the founding of two aviation museums; racing the Bonanza, and, not incidentally, raising two children. The Jessens own an active fixed-base operation at the Boise airport, and, of course, they continue to fly.<br>"Flight is abiding peace.... It is a spirit totally free," wrote Derby winner Louise Thaden, setting the tone for this fascinating history of the first women's transcontinental air race from Santa Monica, Calif., to Cleveland, Ohio. Nicknamed the "Powder Puff Derby" by Will Rogers, a strong supporter of female aviators (despite the belittling nickname) who volunteered to fly along the route carrying extra luggage, the contest covered 2,759 miles. Jessen, an aviator and former president of the Ninety-Nines (an international women pilots' association), describes each day of the nine-day event and provides captivating short bios of the 19 flyers, including colorful "Pancho" Barnes, glamorous Ruth Elder and Amelia Earhart. Although some of the aircraft were considered "heavy" and a smaller number "light," all were flimsy propeller planes and only two had closed cockpits. The contestants dealt with myriad equipment problems, illness, exhaustion and possible sabotage (Clare Fahy's wing wires were eaten through with acid). Fatigued after the day's flight, the pilots had to attend lengthy banquets hosted by excited locals wherever they stopped. On the third day of the race, the experienced pilot Marvel Crosson, overcome with carbon monoxide poisoning from the exhaust fumes of her Travelair craft, crash-landed and died. According to Jessen, the women's "triumph did not convert all the world to esteem pilots of the `weaker' sex," and public figures like Charles Lindbergh, for instance, were all but scornful of their endeavor. Although Jessen includes too much fictionalized dialogue, this otherwise well-wrought bit of Americana will appeal to aviation and women's history buffs.

As Viceroy of India, his deal with Gandhi ended the Civil Disobedience campaign before it could force the British to quit. His meeting with Hitler in 1937 was a milestone in appeasement, yet just days before Munich, Halifax repudiated the policy and demanded &#39;the destruction of Nazism&#39;. By May 1940, it was he, not Winston Churchill, who was the choice for Britain&#39;s war leader. Andrew Roberts has drawn on remarkable private documents to present Lord Halifax as an enigmatic, influential and much-maligned politician.</p><p>Andrew Roberts took a first in Modern History at Gonville &amp; Caius, Cambridge. He won the Wolfson History prize for his biography, Salisbury: Victorian Titan. He writes and reviews regularly in the press. He is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature.</p><h2>Always Looking Up: The Adventures of an Incurable Optimist</h2><p>There are many words to describe Michael J. Fox: Actor. Husband. Father. Activist. But readers of <em>Always Looking Up</em> will soon add another to the list: Optimist. Michael writes about the hard-won perspective that helped him see challenges as opportunities. Instead of building walls around himself, he developed a personal policy of engagement and discovery: an emotional, psychological, intellectual, and spiritual outlook that has served him throughout his struggle with Parkinson's disease. Michael's exit from a very demanding, very public arena offered him the time-and the inspiration-to open up new doors leading to unexpected places. One door even led him to the center of his own family, the greatest destination of all. <p><em><strong>The last ten years, which is really the stuff of this book, began with such a loss: my retirement from Spin City. I found myself struggling with a strange new dynamic: the shifting of public and private personas. I had been Mike the actor, then Mike the actor with PD. Now was I just Mike with PD Parkinson's had consumed my career and, in a sense, had become my career. But where did all of this leave Me? I had to build a new life when I was already pretty happy with the old one.</strong></em>. </p><p><em>Always Looking Up</em> is a memoir of this last decade, told through the critical themes of Michael's life: work, politics, faith, and family. The book is a journey of self-discovery and reinvention, and a testament to the consolations that protect him from the ravages of Parkinson's. </p><p>With the humor and wit that captivated fans of his first book, <em>Lucky Man</em>, Michael describes how he became a happier, more satisfied person by recognizing the gifts of everyday life. </p></p><p><strong>Michael J. Fox</strong>began his career as the lovable Alex P. Keaton, the star of the poular sitcom<em>Family Ties.</em>Since then, his career has been a nonstop success story, with blockbuster movies like<em>Back to the Future</em>,<em>The Secret of my Success, Doc Hollywood,</em>and the lead voice in Disney's<em>Atlantis: The Lost Empire</em>. He retired from his award-winning role on<em>Spin City</em>. Michael has won numerous awards, including four Golden Globes, four Emmys, two Screen Actors Guild awards,<em>GQ</em>Man of the Year, and the People's Choice award. He actively lobbies for stem cell research around the country and is very visible in raising money for Parkinsons research with the Michael J. Fox Foundation.At the beginning of ALWAYS LOOKING UP, Michael J. Fox takes note of the &#34;struts&#34; of his life--work, politics, faith, and family--and explains that his memoir is, in a way, thematic, rather than a chronology of the last 10 years. In a familiar, but somewhat changed, voice he recounts the major shifts in his life, which include leaving his acting career, creating the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson&#39;s Research, advocating for PD research, and coping with the disease itself, which has been tyrannical of recent years. However, PD is also a source of Fox&#39;s optimism--which the listener can clearly hear in his poignant and impassioned delivery. While Fox shares many realities, he also offers hope--which he calls &#34;informed optimism.&#34; There&#39;s much to be learned and aspire to here. As an audiobook, this memoir will stay with you for a long time.

The author&#39;s latest excursion into the past takes us back into an earlier reign and shows us scenes from various periods in it. First Edition.</p><p></p><h2>Through the Eyes of an Immigrant</h2><p><p>In <em>A&nbsp;Red Boyhood -- Growing up Under Stalin</em>,&nbsp;we followed a child's perilous journey of survival through war-torn Eastern Europe, Nazi occupation and, as the son of an "enemy of the state" Soviet repression. &nbsp;What happened to that boy, his brave and resolute mother, and his little brother at war's end? &nbsp;Now, the journey continues with Anatole Konstantin's love letter to America in his new memoir,&nbsp;<em>Through the Eyes of an Immigrant.</em></p> <p><em>As a </em>"displaced person",&nbsp;young Anatole arrives in&nbsp;New York in 1949 in pursuit of achieving the American Dream. &nbsp;Often elusive though that dream may be, we cheer as he overcomes, with humor and optimism, the obstacles and challenges of assimilation. Through his personal experience of having endured the harsh realities of living in a totalitarian state, we see mid-century world and American events through his discerning observations to gain new understanding of how Soviet propaganda ensnared a generation of American intellectuals to becoming sympathetic to the cause of Communism.</p> <p>With an array of characters,&nbsp;<em>Through the Eyes of an Immigrant&nbsp;</em>will have you laughing, and at times, marveling at how a young man's persistence, talent, hard work, love of family&nbsp; &#x336;&nbsp; and a little bit of luck&nbsp; &#x336;&nbsp; can make a dream come true."&nbsp;</p></p><p>Anatole Konstantin grew up in Ukraine when it was part of the Soviet Union ruled by Stalin. In 1938, when Anatole was ten years old, his father was arrested by the KGB and the family never heard about him until fifty years later when Gorbachev came to power and they received a letter from the KGB saying that he had been executed and was now being posthumously rehabilitated. This was an admission that he had been innocent. Upon his father&#39;s arrest, the family became &#34;enemies of the people&#34; and barely survived. In 1941 when Germany attacked the Soviet Union, Anatole with his mother and little brother escaped several days before the Germans occupied their town and they became refugees in the Soviet Republic of Kazakhstan in Central Asia. In spite of misery and near starvation, Anatole managed to go to school, and when WW II ended, the family escaped to Poland and then to West Germany where he became a student at the Technical University of Munich. When he graduated as a Mechanical Engineer, the United States was admitting 200,000 Displaced Persons and he came to the land of his dreams. After having worked for twenty years in several companies, Anatole started an engineering consulting company which later became the PDC International Corp. that manufactures packaging machinery. His book, A RED BOYHOOD - Growing Up Under Stalin, describes life under dictatorship and escape from it. He also taught a course on The Rise and Fall of the Soviet Empire at the Lifetime Learners Institute at the Norwalk Community College.A refugee from the Soviet Union settles in the United States and hustles to make a life there in this memoir. In 1949, after fleeing Ukraine and attending a university in Germany, Konstantin (&#34;A Red Boyhood-Growing Up Under Stalin&#34;, 2008) landed in Boston. He had only $22 to his name, warily hidden in the lining of his pants, and the support of his sponsor, the New York Association for New Americans. It wasn&#39;t easy for him to find work as a mechanical engineer, so he barely made ends meet by leapfrogging from one menial job to another. He finally found more promising employment in Ohio, and was eventually able, in 1969 at the age of 40, to start his own business with his brother, Bill. Along the way, he fell in love with a woman named Rosaria Puccio, and they married and had children. The author negotiated their religious differences-he&#39;s decidedly secular and she was raised Catholic-with the help of the Ethical Culture Society, a humanist philosophical group that emphasizes the shared moral ground of the world&#39;s major theologies. Konstantin, an avid reader and lifelong student, later earned a master&#39;s degree from Columbia University in industrial management. In this book, he constantly situates his own personal experience in the context of geopolitical affairs, which largely meant the dramatic unfolding of the Cold War. He also includes astute discussions of American politics, never shying away from analysis of major political figures, such as Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy, or watershed events, such as the Bay of Pigs and Watergate. One recurrent theme is his exasperation with Western credulity: &#34;I was still haunted by the question of why so many Americans and European intellectuals...still believed the Soviet propaganda.&#34; This is the second installment of the author&#39;s memoirs, and as in many autobiographies, there&#39;s plenty of space devoted to quotidian affairs-the details of vacations, personal financial matters, and the like. These discussions will largely interest those who know the author personally, particularly his family members. However, his discussions of communism&#39;s unraveling, and of its intellectual attraction to Westerners, provide a stirring testimony of real, though sometimes ignored, global atrocities. It establishes Konstantin as an extraordinary moral witness who faithfully recorded depredations that man visited upon his fellow man in the name of ideology. An often gripping account of a tempestuous half-century. - KIRKUS REVIEW</p><h2>Dona Flor and Her Two Husbands</h2><p><blockquote><p>"In this second marriage there was no wooing, and this was as it should be, for it does not look right for a widow to be lovemaking in a corner or the doorway, cuddling, hugging, kissing, embracing, touching here, touching there, hand on breasts, slipping down to thigh."</p></blockquote><p>"Poetic, comic, human" is how The Washington Post hailed <i>Dona Flor and Her Two Husbands,</i> the international classic by Jorge Amado, Brazil's foremost novelist. This captivating fable celebrates heated passions, conjugal harmony, the rhythms of the samba, and the delectable joys of cooking. </p><p>Caught up in the pandemonium of carnival, the roguish and irresponsible Vadinho dos Guimaraes dies during a parade, leaving behind his long suffering wife, the irrepressible Dona Flor. As a widow, Flor devotes herself to her cooking school and an assortment of interfering but well-meaning friends who urge her to remarry. The lonely widow finds herself attracted to Dr. Teodoro Madureria, a kind, considerate pharmacist, who is everything the reckless Vadinho was not. Yet after their marriage, though content, Flor longs for her first husband's amorous, and exhausting, sensual pleasures. And Flor's desirous longing is so powerful that it brings the ghost of Vadinho back from the grave--right into her bed. </p></p><p><br>Jorge Amado was born in 1912 in llh�us, the provincial capital of the state of Bahia, whose society he portrays in such acclaimed novels as <i>Gabriela, Clove and Cinnamon; Dona Flor and Her Two Husbands;</i> and <i>Tereza Batista: Home from the Wars.</i> His father was a cocoa planter, and his first novel, <i>Cacau,</i> published when he was nineteen, is a plea for social justice for the workers on the cocoa estates south of Bahia. The theme of class struggle continued to dominate in his novels of the 1930s and '40s, but with the 1950s and <i>Gabriela, Clove and Cinnamon</i>(1958), the political emphasis gave way to a lighter, more novelistic approach. It was in that novel, published in the United States when Amado was fifty and enthusiastically received in some fourteen countries, that he first explored the rich literary vein pursued in <i>Dona Flor and Her Two Husbands.</i> A highly successful film version of <i>Dona Flor</i> was produced in Brazil in 1976.1<br>Vadinho, Dona Flor's first husband, died one Sunday of Carnival, in the morning, when, dressed up like a Bahian woman, he was dancing the samba, with the greatest enthusiasm, in the Dois de Julho Square, not far from his house. He did not belong to the group--he had just joined it, in the company of four of his friends, all masquerading as bahianas, and they had come from a bar on Cabeca, where the whiskey flowed like water at the expense of one Moyses Alves, a cacao planter, rich and open-handed.<br><br>The group was accompanied by a small, well-rehearsed orchestra of guitars and flutes; the four-string guitar was played by Carlinhos Mascarenhas, a tall, skinny character famous in the whorehouses--ah, a divine player. The men were got up as Gypsies and the girls as Hungarian or Romanian peasants; never, however, had a Hungarian or Romanian, or even a Bulgarian or Slovak, swung her hips the way they did, those brown girls in the flower of their youth and coquetry.<br><br>When Vadinho, the liveliest of the lot, saw the group come around the corner and heard the skeleton-like Mascarenhas strumming his sublime four-string guitar, he hurried forward, and chose as his partner a heavily rouged Romanian, a big one, as monumental as a church--the Church of St. Francis, for she was a mass of golden sequins--and announced:<br><br>"Here I come, my Russian from Tororo."<br><br>The Gypsy Mascarenhas, who was also bedecked with glass beads and spangles and had gaudy earrings hanging from his ears, pulsed his four-string guitar still more sonorously, the flutes and Spanish guitars groaned, and Vadinho took his place in the samba with that exemplary enthusiasm he brought to everything he did except work. He whirled in the middle of the group, stomped in front of the mulatta, approached her in flourishes and belly-bumps, then suddenly gave a kind of hoarse moan, wobbled, listed to one side, and fell to the ground, a yellow slobber drooling from his mouth on which the grimace of death could not wholly extinguish the fatuous smile of the complete faker he had always been.<br><br>His friends were under the impression that it was the result of the load he had taken aboard: not the whiskeys the planter had treated them to--those four or five doses would have had little effect on the class of drinker Vadinho was--but all the rum imbibed from the evening before until noon when the Carnival was officially inaugurated at the Triumph Bar, in the Municipal Square--all of it hitting him at once and knocking him out. But the big mulatta was not fooled; a nurse by profession, she knew death when she saw it; it was a familiar sight to her in the hospital. Not, however, to the point of giving her belly-bumps, of winking its eye at her, of dancing the samba with her. She bent over Vadinho, laid her hand on his neck, and shuddered, a chill running through her stomach and up her spine: "Dear God, he's dead."<br><br>Others touched the body, too, felt his pulse, raised his head with its fair hair, listened to his heart. It was useless, a waste of time. Vadinho had taken leave of the Carnival of Bahia for good.<br>2<br>There was a hubbub in the group of dancers and in the street, a rush through the neighborhood, a God-be-with-us sending a shiver through the merrymakers--and on top of everything Anete, a romantic and hysterically inclined young teacher, took advantage of the occasion to have an attack of nerves, with squeals and the threat of fainting. All that act for the benefit of the vain Carlinhos Mascarenhas, for whom that affected creature sighed, always on the verge of swooning, describing herself as hypersensitive, twitching like a cat having its hair rubbed the wrong way when he strummed the guitar. A guitar that was now mute, hanging uselessly from the hands of its player, as though Vadinho had carried off its final notes with him to the other world.<br><br>People came running from every direction; after the news had circulated through the environs, it reached Sao Pedro, Avenida Sete, Campo Grande, rounding up the curious. A small crowd had gathered around the corpse, jogging one another, overflowing with comments. A doctor who lived in Sodre was commandeered; a traffic policeman took out his whistle and blew it uninterruptedly, as though informing the whole city, the entire Carnival, of Vadinho's end.<br><br>"Why, it's Vadinho, the poor thing!" remarked one of the disguised revelers, his mask slipping off, his gaiety gone. All recognized the dead man; he enjoyed great popularity, with his sparkling joyousness, his hairline mustache, his profligate's pride, especially well-liked in places where drinking, gambling, and carousing were the order of the day; and there, so near his home, everyone knew him.<br><br>Another masked man, this one dressed in burlap and wearing a bear's head, pushed his way through the tight group and managed to approach close enough to get a good look. He pulled off his mask revealing a doleful face, with drooping mustache and bald scalp, and murmured: "Vadinho, my brother, what have they done to you?"<br><br>"What happened to him, what did he die of?" people asked one another, and someone answered: "Rum." This was far too simple an explanation of such an untimely death. A stooped old woman gazed at him for a long time and remarked: "Still so young. Why did he have to die so early?"<br><br>There was a crossfire of questions and answers, while the doctor laid his ear on Vadinho's breast. His report was definitive and extinguished all hope.<br><br>"He was dancing the samba, having a wonderful time, and without a word to anyone he fell over completely dead," explained one of his four friends, sobered up as though by magic, and deeply touched. He stood there looking somewhat foolish in his drag, his cheeks red with rouge, his eyes deeply shadowed with burned cork.<br><br>The fact that they were wearing the typical dress of Bahian women should not give rise to any doubts about the five friends' masculinity. They had dressed up in that fashion the better to fool around, to enjoy themselves and have fun, not because of any deviant inclinations laying them open to suspicion. There was not a faggot in the whole lot, praise be to God. Vadinho had even tied under his white starched petticoat a huge cassava tuber, and at every step he raised his skirts and displayed the outsized, pornographic trophy, causing the women to cover their faces with their hands and let out malicious giggles. Now the tuber hung over his bared hip and elicited no laughter. One of his friends noticed it and untied it from Vadinho's waist. But not even so did the dead man look decent and modest; he was a Carnival casualty; yet, he did not even show the blood of a bullet wound or a dagger thrust running down his breast, which would have redeemed him from his air of masquerader.<br><br>Dona Flor, preceded, naturally, by Dona Norma issuing orders and clearing a path, arrived almost at the same moment as the police. When she came around the corner, resting on the supporting arms of her friends, everyone divined that she was the widow, for she was sighing and moaning, not even attempting to control her sobs, a cataract of tears. Moreover, she was wearing a rumpled house dress, which she used when she was cleaning, had on felt bedroom slippers, and had not yet combed her hair. Even so she was pretty, pleasant to look at; small and plump, but not fat; bronze of color; her straight hair so black that it looked bluish; voluptuous eyes; and full lips slightly parted over white teeth. A tasty morsel, as Vadinho himself was in the habit of calling her in his outbursts of tenderness, rare, but for that very reason unforgettable. Perhaps it was owing to his wife's culinary activities that in those idyllic moments Vadinho referred to her as "my little corn fritter, my fried bean cake, my fat little pullet," and these gastronomic metaphors gave a clear idea of a certain housewifely, sensual charm in Dona Flor hidden beneath a calm, easy-going nature. Vadinho knew her weaknesses, brought them out in the open: that banked-down desire of the timid person, that restraint which turned violent and positively unbounded when given free rein in bed. When Vadinho was in the mood, there was no one more charming, nor could any woman resist him. Dona Flor was never able to hold out against his fascination, nor even when she had made up her mind to do so, boiling with indignation and recent affronts. Time and again she had even come to hate him and to curse the day when she had linked her fate to that wastrel.<br><br>But her anguish as she approached Vadinho, so unexpectedly cut down, left Dona Flor in a complete daze, empty of thought, recalling neither those moments of intense tenderness, nor, still less, those cruel days of suffering and loneliness, as though death had divested her husband of all his shortcomings, or as though he had not been guilty of them during his "brief journey through this vale of tears."<br><br>"Brief journey through this vale of tears" was the phrase of the respectable Professor Epaminondas Souza Pinto, touched and confused as he came forward to greet the widow, to express his condolence, even before she had reached her husband's body. Dona Gisa, a teacher, too, and also respectable up to a point, restrained the haste of her colleague and also her laughter. If it was true that the journey of Vadinho through this life had been brief--he had just rounded out thirty-one years--Dona Gisa knew very well that the world had not been a vale of tears for him, but rather a front seat for all the pranks, merrymaking, lies, and sins in sight. Some of them painful and troubling, undoubtedly, putting his heart to severe tests and trials: debts that had to be paid, notes that fell due, cosigners who had to be won over, obligations assumed, payments that could not be put off, complaints, threats of being hauled into court, banks, money-lenders, frowning faces, friends turning their backs on him, not to mention the physical and moral sufferings of Dona Flor. Because, thought Dona Gisa in her garbled Portuguese--she was vaguely North American, had become a Brazilian citizen, and felt herself a Brazilian, but that devilish language, she never could master it!--such tears as there had been during Vadinho's brief span of life had been shed by Dona Flor, and plenty of them, enough for both.<br><br>But in the face of his sudden death, Dona Gisa thought of Vadinho only with sadness and regret: he had been agreeable, in spite of everything, had had his pleasant, attractive side. Nevertheless, not because he was lying there, stretched out in the street in Dois de Julho Square, dead, masquerading as a Bahian woman, was she going to twist the truth, invent another Vadinho out of the whole cloth. She said so to Dona Norma, her neighbor and close friend, but did not receive the assent she had expected. Dona Norma had time and again told Vadinho just what she thought of him, had quarreled with him, preached him sermons that would have touched a heart of stone, one day even threatened him with the police. But at that sad and final hour, she did not want to comment on the outstanding and unpleasant facets of the late lamented; she wanted only to praise his good qualities, his innate good manners, his invariable sympathy, always quick to manifest itself, his loyalty to his friends, his unquestionable generosity (especially at somebody else's expense), his carefree and boundless joie de vivre. Moreover, she was so taken up with helping and looking after Dona Flor that she was not even listening to Dona Gisa's harsh truths. Dona Gisa was like that: the truth above everything else, at times to the point of making her seem unfeeling and callous. Possibly this was a defense mechanism of her own trusting nature, for she was credulous beyond belief and had faith in everybody. No, she was not recalling Vadinho's misdeeds to criticize him or blame him; she had liked him and they often had had long conversations together, Dona Gisa interested in acquainting her self with the psychology of the underworld in which Vadinho moved and had his being, he in telling her tall tales and peeping down the front of her dress at the curve of her full, freckled breasts. Possibly Dona Gisa understood him better than Dona Norma; but quite the opposite of her, she was not going to scant a single one of his defects, she was not going to lie just because he had died. Dona Gisa did not lie even to herself, unless there was no other way out. And that was clearly not the situation in this case.<br><br>Dona Flor made her way through the crowd in the wake of Dona Norma, who went clearing a path for her with her elbows and her great popularity: "Come, step aside, folks, let the poor thing get by . . ."<br><br>There lay Vadinho on the mosaic paving blocks, a smile on his lips, blond and fair, the image of peace and innocence. Dona Flor stood for a moment, looking at him as though she had trouble recognizing her husband, or perhaps, and this was more probable, in accepting the fact, now indisputable, of his death. But only for an instant. With a scream that came from the very depths of her being, she threw herself upon Vadinho, clasping his motionless body to her, kissing his hair, his rouged face, his open eyes, his jaunty mustache, his dead mouth, forever dead.<br>3<br>It was Carnival Sunday, and who did not have an automobile parade in which to participate that night, a celebration at which to amuse himself into the early hours of the morning? Nevertheless, and in spite of all this, Vadinho's wake was a success, an "outstanding event," as Dona Norma proudly pronounced and proclaimed.<br><br>The morgue attendants laid the corpse on the bed in the bedroom, and afterwards the neighbors carried it into the parlor. The employes of the mortuary were in a hurry, their work increased by the Carnival. While others were amusing themselves, they had their hands full with the dead, the victims of accidents and fights. They pulled off the dirty sheet in which the corpse was wrapped and handed the autopsy report to the widow.<br><br>Vadinho lay there as bare as he had come into the world, on the iron double bed with wrought headpiece and feet which Dona Flor had bought secondhand at a furniture auction six years before, at the time of their marriage. Dona Flor, alone in the room, opened the envelope and read over carefully the opinion of the doctors. She shook her head incredulously. Who would ever have said so? Seemingly so strong and healthy, still so young.<br><br>Vadinho boasted that he had never been sick and that he could go eight days and eight nights without sleeping--gambling, drinking, carousing with women. And at times didn't he really spend a week without showing up at home, leaving Dona Flor beside herself, out of her mind? Nevertheless, there was the report of the doctors of the School of Medicine: a man whose days were numbered, his liver not working, his kidneys worn out, his heart useless. He could drop dead at any moment, as he had done, without warning. Rum, nights in the casinos, drunken sprees, running every which way to find money to gamble with had played hob with that handsome, strong body, leaving it nothing but its outward appearance. And that was a fact, for who, judging only by its looks, would have dreamed that it was totally burned out?<br><br>Dona Flor gazed down at her husband's body before calling in the helpful and impatient neighbors for the delicate task of dressing it. There he was, naked, as he loved to lie in bed, a golden down covering his arms and legs, a thick growth of golden hair on his chest, the scar of a knife wound on his left shoulder. So handsome, such a man, such an artist in bed. Once more the young widow's eyes filled up with tears. She tried not to think what she was thinking about; that was not fitting on the day of a wake.</p><h2>The Ford dynasty: An American story</h2><p>Used Book</p><p></p><h2>Deep Soul Cleansing</h2><p>This volume has been compiled using quotes from 13 of AA&#39;s books for use in living experience of the &#34;Programme,&#34; which we recognise as the Steps.

The FBI accused the pair of transporting the explosive device knowingly as part of a violent campaign of &#34;ecotage.&#34; From her hospital bed, Bari charged that the timber interests of Northern California and the FBI had tried to kill her. The car bomb and the competing conspiracy theories about who was responsible made Bari a national figure; but she had long been a legendary figure among California activists. A veteran of the Vietnam War protests of the 1960s who moved to militant feminism and environmentalism after the war ended, Bari was involved in the radical eco-organization Earth First! by the mid-1980s and leading the fight against the logging companies on the Northern California coast. Not long before the attempt on her life, she had summoned young people from all over the country to join her in a crusade to save the remaining redwood forests of the Pacific Coast in a &#34;Redwood Summer&#34; based on the Mississippi Summer of the civil rights movement a quarter-century earlier. The Secret Wars of Judi Bari traces Bari&#39;s rise from college activist to a would-be Mother Jones of the Redwoods. Drawing on extensive interviews with Bari&#39;s friends, comrades and critics, Kate Coleman describes Bari&#39;s long struggle for selfhood against her communist parents and her husband (himself a former member of violent political groups); against those in her movement who felt that she was not radical enough; and ultimately against the FBI and the State of California. Judi Bari&#39;s wars continued until her death from cancer five years after the explosion that changed her life forever. In creating a dramatic portrait of a unique American life, Coleman takes the reader inside the radical politics that outlived the 1960s, and into the Earth First! movement and the back-to-nature counterculture of the North Coast of California. This is a world that Coleman has lived in herself and spent her career documenting as a writer. In The Secret Wars of Judi Bari she has produced a book that is at once a crime story, a social history, and a compelling biography of a woman at war with her world.</p><p>Kate Coleman is a veteran investigative reporter who has covered the Black Panther Party, the counterculture and California politics for &#34;Newsweek,&#34; the &#34;Los Angeles Times,&#34; &#34;Salon,&#34; &#34;Mother Jones&#34; and other publications.

Along the way, she manages to cure her sickly cousin Colin, who is every bit as imperious as she. These two are sullen little peas in a pod, closed up in a gloomy old manor on the Yorkshire moors of England, until a locked-up garden captures their imaginations and puts the blush of a wild rose in their cheeks; "It was the sweetest, most mysterious-looking place any one could imagine. The high walls which shut it in were covered with the leafless stems of roses which were so thick, that they matted together.... 'No wonder it is still,' Mary whispered. 'I am the first person who has spoken here for ten years.'" As new life sprouts from the earth, Mary and Colin's sour natures begin to sweeten. For anyone who has ever felt afraid to live and love, <i>The Secret Garden</i>'s portrayal of reawakening spirits will thrill and rejuvenate. Frances Hodgson Burnett creates characters so strong and distinct, young readers continue to identify with them even 85 years after they were conceived. <i>(Ages 9 to 12)</i>What secrets lie behind the doors at Misselthwaite manor? Recently arrived at her uncle's estate, orphaned mary Lennox is spoiled, sickly, and certain she won't enjoy living there. Then she discovers the arched doorway into an overgrown garden, shut up since the death of her aunt ten years earlier. Mary soon begins transforming it into a thing of beauty--unaware that she is changing too.<p></p><p>But Missalthwaite hides another secret, as Mary discovers one night. High in a dark room, away from the rest of the house, lies her young cousin Colin, who believes he is an incurable invalid, destined to die young. His tantrums are so frightful, no one can reason with him. If only, Mary hopes, she can get Colin to love the secret garden as much as she does, its magic wil work wonders on him.</p></p><h2>The Stone-Campbell Movement: A Global History</h2><p><i>The Stone-Campbell Movement: A Global History</i> tells the story of Christians from around the globe and across time who have sought to witness faithfully to the gospel of reconciliation.

Walker Professor of Church History at Emmauel School of Religion in Johnson City, Tennessee.</p>A great deal of historical effort is required if religious traditions want to make inclusion, global, and<br> diversity concretely meaningful instead of just aspirational. This well-researched, carefully organized,<br>and consistently insightful history of the Stone-Campbell Movement represents a very positive step in<br>that direction. This major study is particularly welcome for how it integrates the history of better-known<br>Restorationist groups in the United States and Britain with innovative treatments of the movement<br>throughout the whole world. <br><br>- Mark A. Noll, University of Notre Dame<br> This book is a triumphant achievement. Here, fourteen historians speak in one voice to tell one of the most<br>inspiring stories in the history of Christianity. For all who wish to understand how what began as small<br>groups of faithful Americans gained a global presence, they need only turn these pages. The Stone-Campbell<br>story unfolds here in all its grandeur. <br><br>- Glenn Thomas Carson, Disciples of Christ Historical Society<br> This is a work of great importance, showing how religious history gathers the great spheres of human<br>endeavor to widen horizons through the struggles and achievements of individuals and groups. The ideas<br>and movements that fashioned these new communities of faith had a lively sense of justice and a global<br>outlook. The book combines meticulous scholarship and clarity of style to offer an engagingly comprehensive<br>account of the Stone-Campbell Movement. <br><br>- Lamin Sanneh, Yale Divinity School<br> This new global history is at once both impressive and unprecedented. The volume is a breathtaking effort to<br>chronicle developments in a significant worldwide movement. Not only are churches around the globe under<br>purview, but insights are set out in regard to race, gender, mission strategy, social climate, and theological<br>predilections. The reader is rewarded with rich and fascinating details in respect to the topics presented. A<br>digesting of this book is imperative for all those who wish an enriched appreciation of their own legacy. <br><br>- Thomas H. Olbricht, Pepperdine University<br> <i>The Stone-Campbell Movement: A Global History </i> is a monumental achievement. Collaborative style and<br>international reach make it pace-setting for church histories of the future. Editors Williams, Foster, and<br>Blowers marshal a team of experts in fashioning a sweeping narrative of the three worldwide churches<br>originating from the Stone-Campbell early nineteenth-century movements for Christian unity. This history is<br>now essential reading for anyone claiming to know anything or care at all about these churches. More, it is a<br>case study of Christian cross-cultural encounters and an appealing read. --- James Duke, Brite Divinity School</p><h2>The Existential Pleasures of Engineering</h2><p>In a world where engineering plays an increasingly important role, one wonders about the exact nature of the engineering experience in our time. In this second edition of The Existential Pleasures of Engineering, Samuel Florman perceptively explores how engineers think and feel about their profession.<br>Dispelling the myth that engineering is cold and passionless, Florman celebrates it as something vital and alive. He views engineering as a response to some of our deepest impulses, rich in spiritual and sensual rewards. Opposing the "antitechnology" stance, Florman brilliantly emerges with a practical, creative, and fun philosophy of engineering that boasts his pride in his craft.</p><p>...clear, erudite, and occasionally eloquent, a useful read for engineers given to self-scrutiny and a stimulating one for the layman interested in the ancient schism between machines and men's souls. -- <i>Time Magazine</i><p><b>Samuel C.

Heroin is not highly addictive; withdrawal from it is not medically serious; addicts do not become criminals to feed their habit; addicts do not need any medical assistance to stop taking heroin; and contrary to received wisdom, heroin addiction most certainly IS a moral or spiritual problem.<br>Based on his experience as a prison doctor and as a psychiatrist in a large general hospital in Birmingham, Dr. Dalrymple argues that addiction to heroin is not an illness at all, and that doctors only make it worse. They deceive both the addicts and themselves by pretending that they have something to offer.<br>In this brilliant, entertaining and provocative book, Theodore Dalrymple explains how and why a literary tradition dating back to De Quincey and Coleridge, and continuing up to the deeply sociopathic William Burroughs and beyond, has misled all Western societies for generations about the nature of heroin addiction. These writers' self-dramatizing and dishonest accounts of their own addiction have been accepted uncritically, and have been more influential by far in forming public attitudes than the whole of pharmacological science. As a result, a self-serving, self-perpetuating and completely useless medical bureaucracy has been set up to deal with the problem. <br>With scathing wit, implacable logic and savage denunciation, Dr. Dalrymple exposes the mythology surrounding heroin addiction. Moving seamlessly between literature, pharmacology, history and philosophy, he demonstrates what happens when the nature of a social problem is so thoroughly misunderstood, and when human beings are regarded as inanimate objects rather than as agents of their own destiny. His scintillating, iconoclastic little book has an importance far beyond its immediate subject matter.</p><p>&#34;A manifesto on addiction by a truth-telling psychiatrist who explodes conventional wisdom. With customary wit and literary forays into Coleridge and De Quincey, Dalrymple turns his raw experience into gems of clinical insight. Addicts are not passive, nor are they diseased; but they have managed, Dalrymple argues, to seduce a vast treatment bureaucracy into regarding them as medical victims.&#34; - Sally Satel, M.D., author of PC, M.D: How Political Correctness Is Corrupting Medicine &#34;Theodore Dalrymple is a brilliant observer of both medicine and society, and his book wittily engages with two versions of the current nonsense: orthodox medicine on drug addiction, and romantic poets on the wisdom you supposedly enjoy from getting high.&#34; - Kenneth Minogue, professor emeritus at The London School of Economics and author of The Liberal Mind</p><h2>The Canadian militia from 1855: An historical summary</h2><p>military history</p><p></p><h2>The Strawberry Thief</h2><p><p><b>The compelling new novel from the author of the bestselling <i>Chocolat</i>.</b></p><p>Vianne Rocher has settled down. Lansquenet-sous-Tannes, the place that once rejected her, has finally become her home. With Rosette, her 'special' child, she runs her chocolate shop in the square, talks to her friends on the river, is part of the community. Even Reynaud, the priest, has become a friend. </p><p>But when old Narcisse, the florist, dies, leaving a parcel of land to Rosette and a written confession to Reynaud, the life of the sleepy village is once more thrown into disarray. The arrival of Narcisse's relatives, the departure of an old friend and the opening of a mysterious new shop in the place of the florist's across the square - one that mirrors the chocolaterie, and has a strange appeal of its own - all seem to herald some kind of change: a confrontation, a turbulence - even, perhaps, a murder...</p></p><p><p><strong>JOANNE HARRIS</strong>is an Anglo-French author, whose books include fourteen novels, two cookbooks and many short stories.

In 1630, he sailed for North America in search of religious liberty. Finding the same religious restrictions in Boston as he had in England, he established a schismatic church. He was asked to leave Boston and Massachusetts in 1635 and he took refuge with the Indians, with whom he would remain friends and fight for their liberty as well. He called the new settlement Providence, and established there the first Baptist church in the colonies. In 1643 he went back to England securing a new title for the colony. While there he wrote his remarkable and world-changing pamphlet, The Bloudy Tenent of Persecution, published in 1644 to great critcism and cries of heresy.<br>Williams returned to his colony soon called "Rhode Island" to champion religious liberty throughout the colonies. His heroic fight never ceased. His cause, however, would never ease.

Since the 1970s, Kapoor--through poetically abstract works in materials as diverse as stone, steel and glass--has explored the themes of spirituality and transcendence, a preoccupation that has its roots in his native India. This volume introduces three performative wax pieces, unlike any he has previously produced: a technician loads a nine-foot-long cannon, which sends a 40-pound blood-red wax blob shooting into the corner. The resulting trace has been described as &#34;a giant gunshot wound.&#34; Also included is an essay by Vito Acconci, and published together here for the first time are Kapoor&#39;s works in wax from 1992 to the present and his print work from 1987 onward, enabling a closer exploration of the interplay between painting and sculpture in his oeuvre.</p><p></p><h2>The Essential Monster Movie Guide: A Century of Creature Features on Film, TV, and Video</h2><p>More than 3,500 reviews of the best and the worst creature features of all time fill this largest, most comprehensive volume ever published on the subject-a record of dark fantasy on film to thrill horror and science-fiction fans of all ages.

Not the kind of passionate, thrilling happy that can quickly turn into disappointment, but the calm happy that comes when life is steadily going along just the way it should. Three weeks earlier she&#x2019;d started seventh grade at the middle school, which was turning out not to be as overwhelming as rumored, mostly because she and her best friend, Anna, shared all the same classes. And it was late September, and the leaves were on the verge of bursting into wild colors&#x2014;Rosalind adored autumn. And it was a Friday afternoon, and although school was all right, who doesn&#x2019;t like weekends better?<br><br>On top of all that, Aunt Claire was coming to visit for the weekend. Beloved Aunt Claire, whose only flaw was that she lived two hours away from the Penderwicks&#x2019; home in Cameron, Massachusetts. But she tried to make up for it by visiting often, and now she was arriving this evening. Rosalind had so many things to tell her, mostly about the family&#x2019;s summer vacation, three wonderful weeks at a place called Arundel in the Berkshires. There had been many adventures with a boy named Jeffrey, and for a while Rosalind had thought that she might be in love with another boy&#x2014;an older one&#x2014;named Cagney, but that had come to nothing. Now Rosalind was determined to stay away from love and its confusions for many years, but still she wanted to talk it all over with her aunt.<br><br>There was lots to get done before Aunt Claire arrived&#x2014;clean sheets on the bed, clean towels in the bathroom, and Rosalind wanted to bake a cake&#x2014;but first she had to pick up her little sister Batty at Goldie&#x2019;s Day Care. She did so every day on the walk home from school, and even that was part of her happiness. For this was the first year her father had given her the responsibility for her sisters after school and until he came home. Before now, there had always been a babysitter, one or another of the beautiful Bosna sisters, who lived down the street from the Penderwicks. And though the Bosnas had been good babysitters as well as beautiful, Rosalind considered herself much too old now&#x2014;twelve years and eight months&#x2014;for a babysitter.<br><br>The walk from Cameron Middle School to Goldie&#x2019;s took ten minutes, and Rosalind was on her last minute now. She could see on the corner ahead of her the gray clapboard house, with its wide porch full of toys. And now she could see&#x2014;she picked up her pace&#x2014;a small girl alone on the steps. She had dark curls and was wearing a red sweater, and Rosalind ran the last several yards, scolding as she went.<br><br>&#x201c;Batty, you&#x2019;re supposed to stay inside until I get here,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;You know that&#x2019;s the rule.&#x201d;<br><br>Batty threw her arms around Rosalind. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay, because Goldie&#x2019;s watching me through the window.&#x201d;<br><br>Rosalind looked up, and it was true. Goldie was at the window, waving and smiling. &#x201c;Even so, I want you to stay inside from now on.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;All right. But&#x2014;&#x201d; Batty held up a finger swathed in Band-Aids. &#x201c;I just was dying to show you this. I cut myself during crafts.&#x201d;<br><br>Rosalind caught up the finger and kissed it. &#x201c;Did it hurt terribly?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; said Batty proudly. &#x201c;I bled all over the clay and the other kids screamed.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That sounds exciting.&#x201d; Rosalind helped Batty into her little blue backpack. &#x201c;Now let&#x2019;s go home and get ready for Aunt Claire.&#x201d;<br><br>Most days the two sisters would linger on their walk home from Goldie&#x2019;s&#x2014;at the sassafras tree, with leaves shaped like mittens, and at the storm drain that flooded just the right amount when it rained, so you could splash through without getting water in your boots. Then there was the spotted dog who barked furiously but only wanted to be petted, and the cracks in the sidewalk that Batty had to jump over, and the brown house with flower gardens all around, and the telephone poles that sometimes had posters about missing cats and dogs. Batty always studied these carefully, wondering why people didn&#x2019;t take better care of their pets.<br><br>But today, because of Aunt Claire&#x2019;s visit, they hurried along, stopping only for Batty to move to safety a worm that had unwisely strayed onto the sidewalk, and soon they were turning the corner onto Gardam Street, where they lived. It was a quiet street, with only five houses on each side, and a cul-de-sac at the end. The Penderwick sisters had always lived there, and they knew and loved every inch of it, from one end to the other. Even when Rosalind was in a hurry, like today, she noted with satisfaction the tall maples that marched along the street&#x2014;one in every front yard&#x2014;and the rambling houses that were not so young anymore, but still comfortable and well cared for. And there was always someone waving hello. Today it was Mr. Corkhill, mowing his lawn, and Mrs. Geiger, driving by with a car full of groceries&#x2014;and then Rosalind stopped waving back, for Batty had broken into a run.<br><br>&#x201c;Come on, Rosalind!&#x201d; cried Batty over her shoulder. &#x201c;I hear him!&#x201d;<br><br>This, too, was part of their everyday routine. Hound, the Penderwicks&#x2019; dog, always knew when Batty was almost home, and set up such a clamor he could be heard all up and down Gardam Street. So now both sisters were running, and in a moment, Rosalind was unlocking their front door, and Hound was throwing himself at Batty as though she&#x2019;d been away for centuries instead of just the day.<br><br>Rosalind dragged Hound back into the house, with Batty dancing alongside in an ecstasy of reunion. Down the hall they all went, through the living room and into the kitchen&#x2014;where Rosalind opened the back door and shoved the joyful tangle of child and dog into the backyard. She shut the door behind them and leaned against it to catch her breath. Soon Batty would need her afternoon snack, but for now Rosalind had a moment to herself. She could start on the cake, which she&#x2019;d decided should be a pineapple upside-down one.<br><br>Humming happily, she took the family cookbook from its shelf. It had been a wedding gift to her parents, and was full of her mother&#x2019;s penciled notes. Rosalind knew all the notes by heart, and even had her favorites, like the one next to candied sweet potatoes&#x2014;An insult to potatoes everywhere. There was no note next to pineapple upside-down cake. Maybe if it was a great success, Rosalind would add her own. She did that sometimes.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>Prairie Wildflowers</h2><p>America&#x2019;s prairies are home to some of the most abundant and beautiful wildflowers in the country.

She is a certified marriage and family counselor, a Texas Tech graduate and writer-in-residence at West Texas A&amp;M University. She lives with her husband in Amarillo, Texas.<br><br>Sidney Dickerson fought down a shudder as she turned up the heat inside her aging Jeep Cherokee and stared at the oldest house in Clifton Creek. Rosa Lee Altman's property. Sidney had lived in Texas for over a year, yet every time she drove down Main Street this one place drew her as if calling her home. In October's evening shadows, the once grand dwelling looked neglected and sad. One of the gap&#x2013;toothed shutters swung in the wind, making a second&#x2013;floor window appear to be winking.<br><br><em>I'm coming inside, tomorrow. </em>She almost said the words aloud to the house. <em>After a year of watching and waiting, I'll finally walk inside.</em><br><br>The Altman house had been built almost a hundred years ago. In its time, she guessed it had been grand sitting out on the open land by itself, with nothing but cattle grazing all the way to the horizon. Barns, bunkhouses, smoke sheds and kitchens must have sprung up like wild&#x2013;flowers around a rose. A fitting house for Henry Altman, the town's father.<br><br>When the railroad arrived a mile away, it had been natural for business to move close to the tracks. Sidney had read that Henry had donated the land for the rail station and the bank, then charged dearly for the lots nearby. The article said he thought to keep a mile between him and the town but, as years passed, folks built along the road from the train station to his mansion, developing Main Street right up to his front yard.<br><br>Sidney glanced back at the tattered little town of Clifton Creek. If it had grown to more than five or six thousand, the population would have surrounded the remaining Altman land. But, since the fifties, the town had withered with age and the Altman house sat on a rise overlooking its decline. The train still ran along the tracks but passed the abandoned station without stopping. Nowadays cattle and cotton were trucked to Wichita Falls. Eighteen&#x2013;wheelers hauled in most supplies. Oil ran in pipelines.<br><br>The shadow of the old house reached the windows of her Jeep. Sidney huddled deeper into her wool blazer. She would be forty next week. The same age Rosa Lee had been the year her father, Henry Altman, had died. He had built an empire along with this house. Cattle and oil had pumped through his land and in his blood.<br><br>Sidney closed her eyes realizing the old man must have known his forty&#x2013;year&#x2013;old daughter would be the end of the line. He'd built the ranch and the ten&#x2013;bedroom house for a spinster. She couldn't help but wonder if he had encouraged his only child to marry, or had he kept her cloistered away?<br><br>Slipping on her glasses, Sidney stared at the house that had been Rosa Lee's so long folks in the town called the place by her name. Wild rosebushes clung to the side walls as if protecting it. Old elms, deformed by the wind and ice, lined the property's north border. The old maid had left the place to the town when she'd died two years ago, but it would be Sidney who would help determine the house's fate.<br><br>Demolish or restore? The choice seemed easy, considering its condition. Even the grand white pillars that once guarded the double&#x2013;door entry were yellowed and chipped. Sidney loved the historical significance of Clifton Creek's founding father's house, but she couldn't ignore how desperately the town needed money. An oil company had made what seemed a fair bid for the land and the mayor had told her the crest, where the house sat, would be the ideal spot for drilling. Sacrificing a house for the town seemed practical, but she couldn't help but wonder if anyone but her would miss the old place at the end of Main.<br><br>She flipped open her briefcase on the passenger seat beside her. Beneath stacks of freshman History papers and a file on everything she could dig up about the house, she found a wrinkled old card, water spotted, corners bent. On the front of the card, her grandmother had pasted a recipe clipped from a Depression&#x2013;era newspaper of Clifton Creek. On the back was one sentence written in a shaky hand. "Never forget the secrets of Rosa Lee."<br><br>Sidney fought frustration. How could she remember something she never knew? Once, Sidney had heard her mother say that Granny Minnie had worked in Texas as a nurse until her husband had found a job in Chicago. But, Sidney couldn't remember the name of the town.<br><br>She flipped over the card as she had a hundred times before. Two years ago, her mother and Granny Minnie had been killed in a car wreck a hundred miles south of Chicago. Her mother's and grandmother's wills had been standard&#x2014;except for one item. Minnie had left Sidney a safety deposit key. Locked away, Sidney had found only an old recipe box. An unorganized mixture of forgotten recipes shuffled in with cards and notices for baby showers and weddings that Minnie must have collected over years.<br><br>Sidney had looked through the box a few days after the funerals, wondering what had been so important. Why would she have left Sidney, her only grandchild, a worthless box filled with forgotten memories?<br><br>This card had to hold the answer. The secret her mother had never taken the time to pass on. A secret her grandmother had thought they must never forget.<br><br>Sidney shook her head. She'd taken a teaching job here at Clifton College because of this one card. She had moved halfway across the country in search of a secret she would probably never find.<br><br>As darkness settled, Sidney knew she would not sleep tonight. The house waited for her. Tomorrow the mayor's handpicked committee would meet to decide what was to be done about the place.<br><br>She smiled, remembering the list of committee members. Like her, most were well&#x2013;known in town...well&#x2013;known and without influence. It had taken her several days to determine why the mayor had chosen them. At first, she had been honored, thinking he had noticed the articles she'd written about the house in the local paper. But when she'd met with him, she'd known the real truth.<br><br>Most folks might only see her as a middle&#x2013;aged, shy professor, but behind her glasses was a sharp mind. Sidney knew enough about politics to realize that this was an election year, and Mayor Dunley didn't plan to do anything to lose votes. If he decided the fate of Rosa Lee's house, some group in town would be upset. But if he let a committee do it&#x2014;a committee made up of people connected to everyone in town&#x2014;no one would contest the outcome.<br><br>Red and blue lights blinked in her back window. Sidney glanced in the Jeep's rearview mirror. It was too dark to make out anything but a tall shadow climbing from the police car. She didn't have to see more. She knew who it was.<br><br>Sheriff Granger Farrington leaned near as Sidney rolled down her window.<br><br>"Evenin', Dr. Dickerson."<br><br>Sidney smiled. The man seemed as proper and stiff as a cardboard cutout of the perfect small&#x2013;town lawman, all starch and order. She might have believed his act if she hadn't seen him with his wife. "Good evening, Sheriff. Is there a problem?"<br><br>"No, just making sure you weren't having car trouble."<br><br>"I'm fine. How's Meredith?"<br><br>A grin cracked his armor. "She's taking it easy. Doc says another month before she'll deliver. I'm thinking of buying stock in Blue Bell. If she eats another gallon of that ice cream, the baby will be born wearing a sweater."<br><br>"She craves it, and you supply it."<br><br>"Yeah, we're in a twisted relationship. She's a Blue Bell junkie, and I'm her contact." He laughed, then straightened. "I'm surprised you're here after dark; haven't you heard the stories about this place?"<br><br>"I heard about them from a few students after I wrote the articles on the house. A madman running through the garden. Chanting in hushed tones drifting through the air, coming from nowhere. Old Rosa Lee's ghost circling the garden, dripping blood over her roses." Sidney laughed. "You believe any of them?"<br><br>The sheriff shook his head. "I've never seen anything but kids parking out here on Saturday night. Adams caught some football players smoking pot in back of the house a year ago."<br><br>Sidney started the Jeep, guessing the sheriff wouldn't leave until she proved the engine would turn over. He'd given her Jeep a jump twice last winter and, knowing Granger, he'd probably heard about the time one of his deputies had helped her when she'd run out of gas along<br><br>Cemetery Road. She couldn't help but wonder if she was on his duty roster. Something scribbled in among the orders, like "watch out for the dingy professor who can't seem to keep her Jeep running."<br><br>The sheriff tapped the canvas roof as the Jeep's engine kicked in. "You know, Dr. Dickerson, when you get ready, Whitman will give you a good trade&#x2013;in on a car. He's got new Cadillacs, but the trade&#x2013;in lot's got a little of everything."<br><br>"I'll think about it." She started to ask one more time if he would call her Sidney. They were about the same age, and he was as close to a friend as she had in this town that welcomed newcomers with the same enthusiasm as they welcomed fire ants. "Good night, Sheriff."<br><br>He touched his hat with two fingers and disappeared back into the shadows.<br><br>Sidney glanced once more at the old house. Cloaked in shadows, it looked romantic, mysterious, haunted. She could almost believe that Rosa Lee, who'd lived all ninety&#x2013;two years of her life there, still watched over the place.<br><br>"Never forget the secrets of Rosa Lee," Sidney whispered and wondered what waited behind the solid double doors.<br><br>Doors that had kept out the world for a lifetime.<br><br>Across town in the Clifton Creek Hotel, Sloan McCor&#x2013;mick dropped his leather duffel bag on the tiny hotel bed and growled. He hated sleeping with his feet hanging off the end. At six foot four, it was the rule rather than the exception when traveling.<br><br>He also hated small towns with their cracker&#x2013;box hotel rooms, where neon signs blinked through the thin drapes all night long and sheets had the softness of cheap paper towels.<br><br>Emptying his pockets on the scarred dresser, he tried to think of one thing he liked about this assignment. He thought he'd grown used to being alone, but no place made him feel more alone than a small town, and Clifton Creek was a classic. In a town over fifty thousand or so, he could blend in, look familiar enough so that folks returned his smile or wave. But in a place this size, people knew he was a stranger and treated him as such.<br><br>"Get the job done and get out." He repeated his rules. "Never get personally involved."<br><br>Sloan pulled a pack of folders from his bag and walked to where one of the double lights above the headboard shone. In the dull glow, he went over the list of committee members.<br><br>The Rogers sisters would be no problem&#x2014;he could probably charm them. Both were retired schoolteachers. From what he'd gathered, they were much loved in the community. Though they lived modestly&#x2014;small house, used van&#x2014;he was surprised to discover close to eight hundred thousand in their combined savings accounts. A nice little nest egg for the two ladies.<br><br>He flipped to the next file. The professor, Sidney Dick&#x2013;erson, would not be as easy to convince. He had listened outside her classroom. Facts, not dreams, would interest her. But, he wasn't sure how to get to her. Dr. Dickerson's interest in the Altman house was far more than mild curiosity. She'd proved that in the half&#x2013;dozen articles she'd written for the paper.<br><br>He flipped to the next member of the mayor's committee. The preacher, Micah Parker, might be convinced "for the good of the community." Sloan had rarely seen a man above thirty so squeaky clean. The private eye he'd hired couldn't dig up a single whisper on the widower, not even in his hometown.<br><br>The last two folders belonged to the troublemaker, Billy Hatcher, and the ad executive, Lora Whitman. Both would probably go for money if he offered. Hatcher worked at the lumberyard and did odd jobs around town. Except for one brush with the law, he'd stayed below the radar. Lora Whitman was another story. She appeared to have lived her life in the public eye ever since she was six and had posed for her father's car ads. When Sloan had flipped through the weekly paper's archives, he'd seen several pictures of her. Homecoming queen, cheerleader, fund&#x2013;raising for one cause then another. Her wedding picture had covered half a page.<br><br>Sloan spread the members' fact sheets across the bed. He only needed four to swing the committee. But which four?<br><br>He grabbed his Stetson and headed toward the bar he had seen a few blocks away. "Time to go fishin'," Sloan mumbled.<br><br>Micah Parker didn't believe in ghosts. He reminded himself of this fact as he jogged toward the edge of town, but there was something strange about the old Altman house. It drew him the way ambulance lights on a highway lured curious drivers.<br><br>He caught himself circling past the place each night when he ran. Something must have occurred there years ago and left its impression on the very air&#x2014;it was not sounds, or odd sightings, but more an emotion that settled on the passerby's skin, thick as humidity just before a storm breaks.<br><br>Like most of those chosen for the mayor's committee, he couldn't wait to go inside and have a look. And tomorrow, he'd get his chance. Reverend Milburn had talked him into another civic committee, this one to decide what to do with Rosa Lee Altman's place. As associate minister, Micah followed orders.<br><br>Even though a relative newcomer in town, Micah had heard the stories about the old maid who had lived to be ninety&#x2013;two. She'd lost her wealth&#x2014;first a section, then a block at a time until nothing had remained in her name but the house and gardens. Some said she'd never ventured beyond her gates. She had had no life outside her property, and folks said no one, not even a delivery man, had stepped beyond her porch.<br><br>Micah studied the house as he crossed the street, his tennis shoes almost soundless. Even in the streetlight he could see that weather had sanded away almost all paint, leaving the two&#x2013;story colonial a dusty brown. The same color as the dirt that sifted through everything over this open land.<br><br>Smiling, he waved at the house. It seemed more than brick and board. Some places have personalities, he thought with a grin. If this one had a voice it would say, "Evenin' Reverend Parker," in a Texas drawl.<br><br>He slowed in the darkness and stretched before turning about and heading back through town. The temperature had dropped during his run. Time to get home.<br><br></p><h2>The Wizard of Odds: How Jack Molinas Almost Destroyed the Game of Basketball</h2><p>In The Wizard of Odds, renowned and best-selling basketball writer Charley Rosen brings us for the first time the full life story of Jack Molinas, one of the greatest basketball players of his era, a man whose gambling addiction and hubris caused his ultimate demise. Drawing on numerous, previously unavailable first-person accounts, including Jack Molinas&#x2019;s own journal and trial transcripts, Rosen presents the true saga of a man who perhaps better than anyone around him understood the weaknesses of the system in which he lived&#x2014;so much so that he convinced himself that he could manipulate that system to his advantage with total impunity, in a life&#x2019;s journey that took him from NBA play to the Mafia and the pornographic film industry, and to an ultimate tragic destiny.</p><p>A native of the Bronx and longtime pal of basketball guru Phil Jackson, <b>CHARLEY ROSEN</b>&nbsp;led the league in technical fouls during each of his six years as a coach in the now-defunct Continental Basketball Association. Since then he has become the world&#x2019;s foremost writer of fiction and nonfiction on the subject of basketball, chronicling the drama that takes place both on and off the court. His many novels include <i>The House of Moses All-Stars</i>, a <i>New York Times</i> Notable Book, and <i>Sammy Wong: All-American</i>. His non-fiction works include <i>The Scandals of &#x2019;51: How the Gamblers Almost Killed College Basketball</i> and <i>More than a Game</i>, with Phil Jackson. Rosen is an analyst for hoopshype.com and a devotee of the Triangle Offense. He lives in Accord, NY.<p>Jack Molinas was a star college and professional basketball player in the 1950s who was expelled from the National Basketball Association in his rookie year for betting on games. He had been manipulating point spreads since his college days at Columbia, and after his expulsion from the NBA he attained his law degree and became a major wheel in the mob-influenced college basketball point fixing scandals of 1961. Eventually sentenced to 15 years in prison for his role as a fixer, he served five before being paroled, forging a new career in pornography, and finally being gunned down under mysterious circumstances. Prolific basketball writer Rosen quotes extensively from lengthy interviews Milton Gross conducted with Molinas in the 1960s for a never-published biography. Because of Molinas's duplicitous, self-serving nature, the reader is never sure how true certain allegations are. A fascinating view of the seamy side of sports gambling, this will be of particular interest to college sports and basketball historians. Recommended for all libraries. John Maxymuk, Rutgers Univ.

Scott Sunquist, a respected scholar and teacher of world Christianity, recovers missiological thinking from the early church for the twenty-first century. He traces the mission of the church throughout history in order to address the global church and offers a constructive theology and practice for missionary work today.<br><br>Sunquist views spirituality as the foundation for all mission involvement, for mission practice springs from spiritual formation. He highlights the Holy Spirit in the work of mission and emphasizes its trinitarian nature. Sunquist explores mission from a primarily theological--rather than sociological--perspective, showing that the whole of Christian theology depends on and feeds into mission. Throughout the book, he presents Christian mission as our participation in the suffering and glory of Jesus Christ for the redemption of the nations.</p><p>"Scott Sunquist has produced a rarity in this book, which combines breadth of theological scope with depth of learning and life in equal measure. This wonderful compendium brings together deep biblical reflection, the wisdom of Christian ages past, and the experience of a lifetime lived in mission. This is a book to savor, ponder, and return to again and again."<br>--<b>Christopher J. H. Wright</b>, Langham Partnership; author of <i>The Mission of God </i>and <i>The Mission of God's People<br></i><br>"This is a clearly written, wonderfully ecumenical introduction to missiology and, indeed, mission theology. Its value lies in conceiving missiology as deeply theological and spiritual, not simply as tips and strategies for more successful evangelism. We often speak of the importance of the <i>missio Dei</i> for an adequate understanding of mission. In this volume Scott Sunquist helps us understand this trinitarian perspective more deeply."<br>--<b>Stephen Bevans, SVD</b>, Catholic Theological Union, Chicago<br><br>"No mere pragmatic missiology, Scott Sunquist's&nbsp;book&nbsp;is&nbsp;replete with theology. This book shows us that we are steeped in suffering and in glory both across time and in&nbsp;today's global and urban challenges.&nbsp;What a high calling."<br>--<b>Miriam Adeney</b>, Seattle Pacific University and Regent College; author of <i>Kingdom without Borders:&nbsp;The Untold Story of Global Christianity<br></i><br>"An outstanding one-volume introduction to missiology. It is creative, unique, and captivating. I will recommend this text to all my colleagues."<br>--<b>Charles Van Engen</b>, School of Intercultural Studies, Fuller Theological Seminary<br><br>"This book offers a fresh understanding of Christian mission endeavor from historical, theological, and ecclesiological perspectives. Scott Sunquist's teaching and living in mission contexts shine through in his expert choice of peoples and events in world Christianity. A must-read for all who reflect on Christian mission and its legacy and prospects."<br>--<b>Reverend Daniel Jeyaraj</b>, Andrew F. Walls Centre for the Study of African and Asian Christianity, Liverpool Hope University, United Kingdom<br><br>"Three mission books in one: Sunquist provides a sweeping history, a comprehensive theology, and an impassioned call for the church to be missional.

The pilots, highly trained special forces aircrew, scanned the land below through night-vision goggles, trying hard to keep low while racing over a desert so featureless that those who misjudged their height could easily fly into the ground.</p><p>BIAP (Baghdad International Airport) was the objective for one of the US armoured brigades that had sped up from Kuwait. But although the armour had reached it, the place was far from secure. Mortar rounds dropped in as the capital of Iraq tottered between decades of authoritarian rule and its uncertain future. The US 3rd Division&#x2019;s race to the capital had been part of the overt military campaign. It came up from the south, accompanied by dozens of embedded reporters. The RAF Chinook, on the other hand, was arriving from a different point of the compass and had been part of an effort that was rarely talked about publicly.</p><p>A few minutes out from their destination, the passengers in the British helicopter started to glimpse the sprawl below. Tracer fire from heavy machine guns snaked into the sky, fires were visible across the city and the desert too. Disbanded Republican Guards, Fedayeen Ba&#x2019;athist irregulars, and the criminals let flooding out of the jails were vying for the streets, turning the city into a cauldron of violence.</p><p>The Chinook came thumping over the apron, its twin rotors producing a huge cloud of dust as it came close to the ground. Taxiing to a halt, the passengers glimpsed more signs of America&#x2019;s eviction of Saddam Hussein. A couple of shot-up Iraqi Airways aircraft, one a Boeing 727 with its tail jutting awkwardly into the air could be seen in the darkness. As one of the early British arrivals recalls, &#x2018;The airport was a defensive perimeter under blackout conditions, with people in shellscrapes and Bradleys in defensive positions.&#x2019;</p><p>The Americans were taking Baghdad. It wasn&#x2019;t a matter of marching straight in but a process of probing attacks. The airport had already served as the launching point for several thunder runs. These were strong armoured reconnaissance missions to test the mettle of those who had vowed to turn the city into a new Stalingrad. Although many Iraqis emerged to take pot shots at the passing tanks, the level of resistance was far less than the Americans, who had planned for 120 days of fighting, had feared. But as the Iraqi capacity for organised violence ebbed away, disorder was breaking out. Well-to-do businessmen were hauled from their cars and dispatched with a shot to the head by those who wanted their wheels. Looters carried off the contents of museums, Ba&#x2019;ath party offices and even hospitals. The settling of scores was beginning too: between those who had been oppressed and the overlords who had trodden them down without mercy. The Sunni minority, and in particular members of Saddam&#x2019;s tribe, the Tikritis, braced themselves for payback from the Shia majority and the Kurds too. Too many had been tortured, bombed or killed for the thing to pass without bloodletting.</p><p>Out of the British Chinook stepped a group of officers with a handful of civilians and some well-armed SAS troops. One of the civilians on board, a young MI6 officer who had not been to war before, questioned whether the machine-gun fire they had seen had been evidence of celebrations. &#x2018;That&#x2019;s one celebration you don&#x2019;t want to be on the end of,&#x2019; quipped a special forces veteran.</p><p>Among the party was Brigadier Graeme Lamb, Director of Special Forces (DSF). Lean and obsessively fit for a man of forty-nine, Lamb had started his military career in the Queen&#x2019;s Own Highlanders. The product of a Spartan Scottish boarding school, he had been reared to shun the rat race and crave adrenalin. He had commanded a squadron in the SAS and later, his regiment of Highlanders. Having experienced command at these levels, Lamb&#x2019;s ambition was almost spent. Friends say he never thought of himself as a general, and had assumed that he would leave the army as a colonel. But Lamb&#x2019;s superiors had other ideas. They had detected that, with his reputation for toughness, easy way with soldiers and special-forces mystique, he was a man whose services needed to be retained. He was one of the few people in the army with the self-confidence, as well as the respect of the old sweats of the SAS, to carry off the job of Director of Special Forces. The brigadier was given to blasphemous plain speaking, and his dismissal of overcomplicated ideas as &#x2018;bollocks&#x2019; made some think of him as anti-intellectual. But as those who knew Lamb would attest, what he always sought was clarity, robustness and the avoidance of bullshit.</p><p>Not long after his appointment as DSF, the world had been shaken by al-Qaeda&#x2019;s attacks on New York and the Pentagon. Summoned to a weekend meeting to brief Tony Blair at Chequers, Lamb surprised the Prime Minister by turning up wearing Bart Simpson socks. As Blair listened, his eyes occasionally turned to the brigadier&#x2019;s ankles. Lamb laid out the ways in which the UK special forces might support the American effort in Afghanistan swiftly and effectively. The briefing carried the same message as his socks: &#x2018;no problemo&#x2019;. He had made his mark with the Prime Minister, whose own world view had been altered dramatically by 9/11. Although the invasion of Iraq would involve much larger conventional forces than the toppling of the Taleban, that early meeting at Chequers had defined a relationship; Blair would take a personal interest in special forces throughout the Iraq campaign.</p><p>As DSF, Lamb had overall responsibility for the various regiments comprising Britain&#x2019;s military elite: the regular and two reserve regiments of Special Air Service; the Royal Marines Special Boat Service; a specialist surveillance unit; and the signallers who supported these forces on operations. The overthrow of Saddam had involved a big military operation of &#x2018;shock and awe&#x2019; air strikes, divisions racing to Baghdad and the thunder runs that had sealed the city&#x2019;s fate. Britain&#x2019;s contribution, exceeding forty thousand servicemen and women, had taken southern Iraq, including the ancient port city of Basra. But Brigadier Lamb&#x2019;s role in this business was part of a different war &#x2013; the mobilisation of hundreds of special forces troops for a secret campaign codenamed Operation ROW.</p><p>In essence Operation ROW was Britain&#x2019;s part of a larger Coalition effort designed to take large parts of the west and north of the country. This would pin down several Iraqi divisions, stopping Saddam either reinforcing his effort against the main invasion, from the south, or thickening Baghdad&#x2019;s defences. The mission of the US, UK and Australian special operators moving in from the west and north was thus to take on entire Iraqi divisions by applying a level of force out of all proportion to their numbers, a task they took on with alacrity. The seizure of large tracts of Iraq &#x2013; perhaps one third of the country &#x2013; bordering Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Syria and Turkey by two special operations task forces totalling a couple of thousand men required them to advance with relentless aggression. With the offensive about to start, and a couple of weeks before his own arrival in Baghdad, Lamb had sent a final message to the UK special forces about to enter battle. Urging them forward, he signed off, &#x2018;Remember, the faint-hearted never fucked a pig!&#x2019; This soldierly exhortation became something of a catchphrase among the special operators.</p><p>Milling about at Baghdad airport, the members of D Squadron of the SAS exchanged greetings with Lamb and the others who had come in on the Chinook. It was a chance to hear news of other elements of the covert offensive. The troopers who had flown in were just a few dozen who had set off from another Middle Eastern country on 19 March. A few of their D Squadron mates were down south as part of an SAS and intelligence team that had been detached to support the advance of the UK&#x2019;s 1st Armoured Division. This team infiltrated the city of Basra, where they brought in strikes against the local Ba&#x2019;athist leadership. Apart from that small band, however, the majority of Britain&#x2019;s special forces had been part of joint Coalition special ops task forces that were supposed to take the place of divisions that would ideally have attacked from the north and west, but which political sensitivities had made impossible. While the rulers of certain countries did not want to risk the wrath of the Arab street by allowing overt movements of US troops through their ports towards Iraq, they had been prepared to accede to the launching of highly secret Coalition attacks from their territory. It was a typical double-dealing Middle Eastern approach, but the commanders of the UK and US special operations forces were used to that from years of operating in the region.</p><p>Most of the British &#x2013; including B Squadron of the SAS &#x2013; had come from the west. This force, including supporting aircraft, Royal Marines and RAF Regiment soldiers, had been limited because of regional nervousness about showing support for President Bush&#x2019;s war. B Squadron drove into the western Iraqi desert in its modified SAS Land Rovers festooned with weapons, looking for ballistic missile launchers along the way. They were still out in the desert when Lamb arrived in Baghdad. Meanwhile, most of D Squadron had been used as a heliborne force in a set-piece operation to seize a desert airfield before pushing on to the Iraqi capital.</p><p>Whereas the SAS had fought mainly in the west, the SBS had joined an American-led taskforce coming from the north. Because of the traditional rivalry between the special forces organisations, by the time the SAS reached the airport there was already much noisy comment ...</p></p><h2>Decoding Your Life: An Experiential Course in Self-Reintegration</h2><p>Decoding Your Life An Experiential Course in Self-Reintegration <p>Janet Swerdlow, globally recognized for her fascinating Oversoul research, has a unique way of guiding you step by step through the inner unraveling process of life&#x2019;s complications.

Robinson</h2><p>*Includes pictures <br> *Includes a bibliography for further reading <br> <p> &#x201c;I know I'm not much on face value, but when it comes to stage value, I'll deliver for you.&#x201d; &#x2013; Edward G. Robinson </p><p> For most enthusiasts of film history, Edward G. Robinson&#x2019;s name is virtually synonymous with the Depression-era gangster films of the 1930s. After all, Robinson starred in Little Caesar (1931), which was one of the first major gangster films and is perhaps the most representative example of the genre. Little Caesar remains his most iconic gangster role, but he acted in several other notable gangster films over the course of the decade, including The Little Giant (1933) and A Slight Case of Murder (1938). Even during the 1940s, after the gangster genre had ceded much of its standing to the postwar film noir genre, Robinson retained his ties to gangster films, memorably playing gangster Johnny Rocco in Key Largo (1948). With his short, round physique and irascible screen persona, Robinson became a kind of cinematic brother to James Cagney, and the two remain the most famous of the Hollywood gangster stars. </p><p> As much as Robinson&#x2019;s fame remains attached to the rise of the gangster films of the 1930s, it also is important to recognize that he was successful in progressing into the postwar noir films&#x2014;a genre that bears important similarities with the gangster genre but reworks it in significant ways. Indeed, Robinson starred in what may have been the most famous gangster picture &#x2013; he played a memorable role in Double Indemnity (1944), which may well be the most famous noir movie ever made. Edward established his status as a worthy noir actor by starring in a duo of underrated Fritz Lang films&#x2014;The Woman in the Window (1944) and Scarlet Street (1945)&#x2014;as well as the Orson Welles movie The Stranger (1946). As his memorable noir performances demonstrate, Edward G. Robinson was more than just a famous gangster villain. He represents someone who was able to successfully navigate the changes in Hollywood cinema from the 1930s through the following decade. </p><p> Interestingly, even as Robinson became a star on the screen, events off screen also made him abdicate his lofty standing. A first-generation immigrant who moved to the United States from Romania while still a child, Robinson&#x2019;s rise in the entertainment industry&#x2014;first on stage and then in Hollywood&#x2014;embodied the Horatio Alger myth of a self-made man. Lacking the conventional attractiveness that characterized most male actors (particularly leading men), it was through his sheer skill and virtuosity that Robinson was able to fashion a successful career. However, if Robinson benefited early in his career from the opportunities presented by Hollywood, it was also at the hands of the industry that his career was compromised during the early 1950s through the efforts of the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). Although he was not a member of the Hollywood Ten, Robinson was a suspected Communist, and his name was tarnished within the acting community and in the eyes of the American public. He would continue to act through the end of his life, but his days as a major figure in Hollywood were brought to an abrupt end. </p><p> Legends of Hollywood: The Life and Legacy of Edward G. Robinson analyzes Robinson&#x2019;s career in the 1930s and 1940s, as well as his real life roles as Hollywood star and victim.. Along with pictures and a bibliography, you will learn about Edward G.

In October 1942, after a two-year seesaw campaign across the wasteland of western Egypt and eastern Libya, the British Eighth Army not only achieved a significant military victory over the combined German-Italian Panzer Army but also provided an enormous psychological boost for the Allies. </p><p> This is the story of two of the most intriguing commanders of the war. Latimer offers remarkably balanced portraits of Bernard Law Montgomery, whose real achievement was overshadowed by his prickly ego, and Erwin Rommel, whose tactical brilliance could not overcome his disdain for the administrative side of war. Alamein, Latimer notes, was a victory for modern armaments, with concentrated artillery used on a scale not seen since 1918. Equally important were the critical contributions of naval and air forces in cutting off the German supply lines and supporting the ground troops, roles largely overlooked in standard accounts. </p><p> But <i>Alamein</i> is at heart the story of the infantry soldiers who fought in a scorched wilderness. Often using their own words, Latimer vividly describes the experiences of the gunners, sappers, cavalrymen, and airmen--Britons, Canadians, Australians, Indians, Germans, Italians, and others--who struggled in the heat, sand, and dust of this brutal environment. </p><p> With their success at El Alamein, the British forces would drive Rommel's army into Tunisia--and ultimate destruction in the North African Campaign of 1943. </p></p><p><b>Jon Latimer</b> lectured at the University of Wales, Swansea and served in the Territorial Army.

Little is known of Vittore Carpaccio&#x2019;s early life, only that he was born sometime between 1455 and 1460. The dominant influences on his early work were those of Gentile Bellini and Antonello da Messina. His first known works do not appear until 1490, the date on one of the canvases in the cycle illustrating the legend of St. Ursula for the Scuola di Santa Orsola. In these celebrated works he emerged as a mature artist of originality, revealing a gift for organization, narrative skill, and a masterly command of light. Carpaccio died some time between 1523 and 1525 and was subsequently neglected for many centuries. He was rediscovered in the nineteenth century, when his precise rendering of architecture, and the luminous atmosphere of his paintings were praised by the English critic John Ruskin.</p><p>PETER HUMFREY, Professor of Art History at the University of St Andrews, is a specialist in Venetian painting of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. He was Guest Curator of the exhibition &#x2018;The Age of Titian: Venetian Renaissance Art from Scottish Collections&#x2019; at the National Gallery of Scotland in 2004.</p><h2>The Silver Chair (The Narnia Chronicles, 6)</h2><p>In the never-ending war between good and evil, The Chronicles of Narnia set the stage for battles of epic proportions.

I had not considered that. So I have been reading the files for two years back. I found these." Encino tapped the stack of folders. "I can't permit you to read them. But"--he sighed eloquently--"I must leave the office for a short time. How can I know what happens behind my back? Please use my desk."Five seconds later, he was gone, and I was alone with his files. There were seven folders. Carol Christie's was on the top, and I took it first. By the time I finished, I was dripping sweat on his blotter. My shirt was soaked and sticking to my back, along with most of my jacket. I didn't ask Encino's permission to use his phone--I just grabbed it and dialed Ginny as well as I could with my hands shaking like cowards."Brew," she started, "what's wrong?"I brushed past her anxiety. "I'm at Missing Persons. You've got to get down here.""Why? What's happened?""There are seven of them," I said. "I don't care what the cops say, this is no accident.""Make sense, Brew! Seven what?""Seven thirteen-year-olds. No, five. Two of them were twelve." I knew I wasn't getting through to her, but I couldn't help myself. I was too upset to pull it together."What the bloody hell are you talking about?"I pushed the phone against the side of my head as hard as I could, trying to make that damn inanimate plastic steady me. I wanted to howl, but I couldn't get enough air into my lungs. "Carol Christie didn't drown because she couldn't swim. She drowned because she OD'ed on heroin. And that's not all. Before she drowned, she--" But I couldn't say it over the phone. Carol was only thirteen. There are some things you can hardly say out loud at all."I'm on my way," Ginny told me. "I'll be there in fifteen minutes." Then the line went dead, leaving me with nothing but an empty phone to hang on to.Copyright � 1980, 2002 by Stephen R.

It helps pull back the curtain which still partly shrouds the world of ancient Egypt in the minds of many people. Close analyses of existing remains by language experts and scientists have shown that hieroglyphs - the unique style of writing composed of pictures - goes back in Egyptian history to at least 3100 B.C. Today the distinctive characters drawn so skillfully by the ancient scribes remain graceful and intriguing, even though the style has not been practiced in Egypt for almost 2,000 years. In Egyptian Hieroglyphs for Everyone, you will learn how hieroglyphic writing can be read. This book is not a mere &#34;do-it-yourself&#34; guide to language learning, but rather a careful and engrossing explanation of how the written language of Egyptian hieroglyphs developed. When going to a museum, the reader will have an understanding of the uses and techniques of this ancient form of communication.</p><p></p><h2>A Dragon-Lover&#39;s Treasury of the Fantastic</h2><p>In this work Margaret Weis gathers together the greatest classic dragon stories of our time, written by the winners of every award in the fields of fantasy and science fiction.</p><p>JANE YOLEN is one of North America&#x2019;s most successful and respected authors for children.

Perhaps because it is- or has become over time and literature the most human in its nature and characteristics. Dragons attract us with their beauty and grace, fascinate us with their magic, lure us with promises of fabulous wealth, illgotten booty, free for the taking, with nary a guilty thought or qualm of conscience, for, after all, we are ridding the world of evil. </p><p>Sometime around 1983, when I first started working as a book editor for TSR, Inc., producers of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons� role-playing games, the marketing department conducted a survey. They asked the players what the company could do to rnake the garne modules better. </p><p>The answer The dungeons are fine. We want more dragons. </p><p>One would think battling dragons every Saturday would lose its thrill, but, being a "gamer" myself, I can assure you that nothing causes the heart of a player to quicken, the eye to brighten, than to discover a gigantic clawed footprint in the path or to hear the peasant relate in panicked tones how, "Yon great winged beast done lifted me daughter clean in the air and made off wit' her!" </p><p>We know that at least half the party won't survive the encounter, but the knowledge of treasure, of battle with a worthy and cunning foe, draws us on. </p><p>Yet, after the hard-fought battle, with a foe worthy of our steel, who among the party doesn't feel a pang of regret when the glorious creature falls from the air, mortally wounded. And as we sneak off, like thieves with the treasure, we talk in hushed, almost reverent tones, of the monster we slew, and we feel-deep inside-ashamed, unworthy. </p><p>We know we have felled something greater, more wondrous than ourselves. </p><p>In this volume I have collected some of my very favorite dragon stories, by some of the best-known authors in the science fiction and fantasy felds. Some, I'm sure, you will come to as old favorites, as interesting and exciting to read again as they were the first time. In others, you will find new and entertaining adventures. </p><p>Just exacdy the sort of book to take along while posting guard on the king's treasure caravan. You are reading, enthralled, when suddenly from the sky above, you hear the creak and flap of huge leathery wings....</p></p><h2>Happy Easter, Mouse!</h2><p>in Mouse from If You Give a Mouse a Cookie as he tries to figure out who&#39;s leaving Easter eggs all over his house!</p><p></p><h2>Auschwitz</h2><p>Reprint, signed without dedication by the author, light wear to dust jacket which is in protective sleeve. Shipped from the U.K. All orders received before 3pm sent that weekday.</p><p>Laurence Rees is Creative Director of History Programmes for BBC Television and a former editor of the Emmy-winning Timewatch, BBC TV&#39;s history documentary series. He has written five previous books, including The Nazis: a Warning from History, War of the Century about the Hitler/Stalin war and Horror in the East, an examination of the war against Japan. The Nazis, War of the Century and Horror in the East were also successful television documentary series - all written and produced by Laurence Rees. This body of work has won him a host of awards, including an International Documentary Association Award and a British Academy Award.Most of us would rather not think about Auschwitz, but that is how the next Auschwitz will happen. Laurence Rees's compact, devastating new history of the infamous death factory distills a crucial lesson -- perhaps the crucial lesson -- of the 20th century: that the human capacity for mass murder is grotesquely widespread and must be faced squarely if we hope to resist it.<p>The systematized, industrialized, conveyor-belt murder of six million Jews and other despised minorities is hard to fathom. I recently visited a community center in Florida where two enormous jars, each as tall as a basketball player and as fat as a sumo wrestler, were being filled with pennies in hopes of collecting six million.</p><p>But as Rees unfolds the singular atrocity of Auschwitz-Birkenau, where one million died, the recurring theme is just how easily it happened. From the monstrous planners to the demoralized bystanders, Europe was full of people willing to countenance the genocide. The ideals of Western civilization were like tissue paper across the tracks of human hatred.</p><p>Auschwitz devolved smoothly from a slave-labor camp to a death camp as Hitler's war in the East bogged down. In village after village, city after city, people watched wordlessly, even jeered triumphantly, as their neighbors were herded toward the transports -- not just the Germans of Berlin and Munich and Leipzig, but Poles in Warsaw, Frenchmen in Paris, Hungarians in Budapest, Slovakians in Bratislava, even, in a few cases, British authorities in the Channel Islands. </p><p>Some of the perpetrators were monsters, like the camp's commandant, Rudolph H�ss, and the master of the human roundups, Adolf Eichmann. Some were ordinary people who could have saved a life or two but just . . . didn't. Most fell in between: They did not plan the genocide, but it did not seem to bother them much. Take the stupidly cruel French police who, without much prodding from the Nazis, organized a large shipment of Jewish women and children: Far from being moved by the suffering they supervised, they heedlessly compounded it, herding the mothers onto transports many days before the children were to be shipped. As Rees recounts in spare, heartbreaking prose, the French authorities made no provision for the orphaned children, leaving them to wander -- terrified and barely fed -- around the French holding camp until trains finally came for them.</p><p>But the killers were not without tender feelings. Rees notes that it upset them very much when the people they were preparing for slaughter began screaming or struggling or fainting. It wore them out when they tried shooting their victims one by one beside mass graves. That is why they built efficient gas chambers, with soundproof walls and nearby crematoria. And it is why they took elaborate steps to mask what they were doing.</p><p>So we find workers at Auschwitz, on Oct. 7, 1944, coaxing the shivering, hungry children from Barrack 8 in the Birkenau annex with a promise of warm winter clothes. Alice Lok Cahana, 15, hoped to scrounge a few garments for her sickly sister, Edith. The children were led to a brick building in a corner of the compound and told to strip off their rags.</p><p>Alice did not panic, and the reason is quite horrible. She noticed "flowers in a window" of the building she was about to enter -- which was, of course, a gas chamber. Flowers made her think of her mother, who loved violets, and so she felt calm. </p><p>Her murder was interrupted by a revolt of the crematoria workers, quickly quelled. Cahana survived to add this arresting and revolting detail to Rees's picture of the camp. </p><p>Rees, a distinguished journalist and historian at the BBC, layers these details with little fanfare but great craftsmanship. His book, and a companion TV documentary, mark the 60th anniversary this month of the liberation of Auschwitz by Soviet troops.</p><p>Ultimately he does at the gut level what Hannah Arendt achieved some 40 years ago at the level of philosophy: He forces the reader to shift the Holocaust out of the realm of nightmare or Gothic horror and acknowledge it as something all too human. He reminds us that building Auschwitz required the services not just of sadists but of architects and engineers, that staffing it required the efforts of physicians and bookkeepers. </p><p>We see again that an impetus for the first gassings came not from Berlin but from Slovakia, whose pro-Nazi government was happy to round up able-bodied Jews to be pressed into slavery in the IG Farben synthetic-rubber works at Auschwitz. Then the Slovaks realized they would be stuck with a Jewish remnant unable to provide for itself, so they paid the Nazis to take the elderly, the frail, the children to Auschwitz as well. Killing them seemed the expedient thing to do.</p><p>Reading this book is an ordeal -- not through any failure of the author's but because of his success. Rees's research is impeccable and intrepid; among other feats, he has tracked down and interviewed former SS members who actually worked at Auschwitz, most of whom express no remorse. Rees also makes good use of the records that became available only after the collapse of the Soviet Union and its satellites.</p><p>These details add up to a precise picture of the death camp -- not only the sadistic kapos, the merciless selections, the industrial-scale killing, but also the perverse love stories, doomed uprisings, weird strokes of luck. Rees tells the bizarre story of the Auschwitz brothel, and details the one successful escape from the camp. He explains why the only hope of survival was a job indoors, and reports that the best jobs were in the warehouses where Jews were compelled to sort and catalogue the stolen possessions of their murdered brethren.</p><p>Scrupulous and honest, this book is utterly without illusions. The nearest thing it has to an uplifting story is the successful effort by Danes to save their country's Jews. Even this ends on a sad note in Rees's hands. Why, he wonders, could similar feats not have been accomplished all across Europe?</p><p>The answer emerges in the final pages, as Rees recounts stories of Auschwitz survivors returning to their homes months and years and even decades later, only to be greeted with fresh bigotry and new violence. More lives were not saved because human beings found it more convenient to hate. The potted bigotry and ludicrous rantings of tyrants spoke more deeply to them than the exhortations of saints. </p><p>It is folly to believe that hatred could be so widespread and so easily activated in 1945 yet be toothless today. Neighbors hacked neighbors to death in Rwanda; mountains of skulls rose in Cambodia; entire classes of people were worked and starved to death in China; even Hitler's brand of bigotry is common currency in much of the world. </p><p>Indeed, hate seems to be thriving. As long as it does, Auschwitz is with us. </p><p>Reviewed by David Von Drehle <br>Copyright 2005, The Washington Post Co.

Its power is cumulative: There are no flashes of startling moments, just a slow unfolding of friendships and feuds, plots and counter plots." <br>&#x2014;Claudia FitzHerbert, <i>Daily Telegraph</i></p><h2>Our Daily Bread</h2><p><p>A novel about what happens when we view our neighbours as "The Other" and the transformative power of unlikely friendships; <em>Our Daily Bread</em> is inspired by the true story of the Goler Clan of Nova Scotia. <br></p><p>The God-fearing people of Gideon shun the Erskine Clan, who have lived on North Mountain in poverty, secrecy and isolation, believing their neighbours to be beyond salvation. "That's the mountain," they say. "What do you expect from those people?" <br></p><p>Yet in both groups nearly everyone has secrets and nothing is as it seems. <br></p><p>On the mountain, Albert Erskine dreams of a better and safer life for his younger brothers and sisters. He lives by his code: "You keep your secrets to yourself and you keep your weaknesses a secret and your hurts a secret and your dreams you bury double deep." <br></p><p>In town, young Ivy Evans is relentlessly bullied by her classmates. Though her father, Tom, is a well-liked local, his troubled marriage to a restless outsider is a source of gossip. As rumors and innuendo about the Evans family spread, Ivy seeks refuge in Dorothy Carlisle, an independent-minded widow who runs a local antique store. <br></p><p>When Albert ventures down the mountain and seizes on the Evanses' family crisis as an opportunity to befriend Ivy's vulnerable teenage brother, Bobby, he sets in motion a chain of events that changes everything. <br></p></p><p>One of the things I've been troubled by in the past few years is the increasing polarization I see around me.&nbsp; It pops up in any number of places - religion, politics both local and international, public rhetoric, the media, etc.&nbsp; We don't have to look far for examples - perhaps no farther than our prisons, or the town next door, or even in our own families.<br> I write to figure out what I think about things and to attempt to find meaning.&nbsp; I try to find metaphors in which to explore my feelings and thoughts on what obsesses me.<br><br> As I pondered my concerns about the ever-widening gaps I noticed around me, a story from my past kept rising to the surface.&nbsp; I lived in Nova Scotia for a brief time in 1972-1973.&nbsp; While there, I heard stories about a community up on a nearby mountain.&nbsp; They were terrible stories, involving incest, aborted and deformed babies, prostitution, bootlegging and so forth.&nbsp; I told myself these dreadful tales couldn't be true. I believed, naively, that if they were true, surely someone would have done something about it. Then, in the early 1980s one of the children of the Goler clan told her story of generational abuse to a teacher.&nbsp; This teacher came from another province and hadn't been in Nova Scotia very long.&nbsp; She in turn called an RCMP officer, who also hadn't been in the community for very long. They insisted an investigation begin and eventually many of the clan adults were in jail and the children in foster care.<br>I was horrified, but also mystified.&nbsp; If all those rumors were true, why had it taken so long for someone to intervene? Well, the answer seemed to be that the people who lived on the mountain had, for generations, been considered "Those People" as in "What do you expect from <i>those</i> people?"&nbsp; The people who lived in the prosperous Annapolis Valley nearby, in communities founded hundreds of years earlier on Puritanical religious principles, believed their neighbors were so "Other" as to be beyond the pale.<br>The extreme marginalization of the community and the terrible repercussions of ostracism haunted me and it seemed the perfect framework to explore how such ordinary people could do such dreadful things, or permit such dreadful things to continue.<br>I have had several instances in my own life of feeling like the "Other." &nbsp;Although I explore the theme more personally in my previous novel, THE STUBBORN SEASON, in which a young girl battles the tyranny of living with a mentally ill mother during the Great Depression, in OUR DAILY BREAD the character of Ivy Evans is based on some of my own experiences with marginalization.&nbsp; My family, afflicted by mental illness and alcoholism, was going through a rough time the summer I was nine.&nbsp; I was an only child, and adopted, and rather bookish and prone to making up stories, all of which helped to make me 'Other' in the eyes of some of the children in the neighborhood.&nbsp; That summer, a lady who owned a little antique shop near my house let me hang around the store.&nbsp; I'm sure she never knew just how much that meant to me, but it was a refuge from loneliness and bullying and I've never forgotten it.<p><strong>LAUREN B.

This work had a profound effect on Charleson, perhaps because, for her, this journey began as a personal one: Charleson herself struggled with posttraumatic stress disorder for months after a particularly grisly search. Collaboration with her search dog partner made the surprising difference to her own healing. Inspired by that experience, Charleson learns to identify abandoned dogs with service potential, often plucking them from shelters at the last minute, and to train them for work beside hurting partners, to whom these second-chance dogs bring intelligence, comfort, and hope. <br>Along the way she comes to see canine potential everywhere, often where she least expects it &#x2013; from Merlin the chocolate lab puppy with the broken tail once cast away in a garbage bag, who now stabilizes his partner&#x2019;s panic attacks; to Ollie, the blind and deaf terrier, rescued moments before it was too late, who now soothes anxious children; to Jake Piper, the starving pit bull terrier mix with the wayward ears who is transformed into a working service dog and, who, for Charleson, goes from abandoned to irreplaceable.</p><p>HMH&nbsp;Hardcover, 2013Previous ISBN: 978-0-547-73493-4Advance Praise for THE POSSIBILITY DOGS:<br><br>"What an amazing book.

Haunted by AIDS and by the difficulty of connecting romantically even under the best of circumstances, his characters are perplexed realists doing battle with unreasonable fears and towering problems. Often isolated or adrift, they seek to understand the incomprehensible. A young man's fractured family and dim past in "Snapshot" lead him to yearn for love without fully grasping the extent of his need, so that "to want and want and want, and not to know that you are wanting, means that you are never sure of anything." In "The Body and Its Seasons," a disillusioned student searches for solace in sex, concluding, " 'This intimacy thing is highly overrated.' " Barnett's willingness to venture into explosively emotional terrain with empathy, candor and balance is perhaps best revealed in his stunning "The Times As It Knows Us," where men sharing a summerhouse appear to have created family within the gay community--yet even this proves illusory. Though occasionally overcrowded with allusions to art, architecture and culture, the book incisively reveals that in our hearts and souls, as well as our bodies, lie the real dangers. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Loud Bones: The Jewelry of Nancy Worden (Northwest Perspective)</h2><p>For more than three decades, Northwest artist Nancy Worden has explored the cultural dynamics that shape contemporary social and political agendas, emphasizing the female experience in the United States.

It became a #1<i> New York Times</i> bestseller and was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize. Now in <i>The Death of Innocents, </i>she takes us to the new moral edge of the debate on capital punishment: What if we&#x2019;re killing the wrong man?<br><br>Dobie Gillis Williams, an indigent black man from rural Louisiana with an IQ of 65, was accused of a brutal rape and murder. Williams&#x2019;s inept defense counsel, later disbarred for unethical practice for unrelated cases, allowed the prosecution&#x2019;s incredibly contrived scenario of the crime to go unchallenged. Less than two years after Williams&#x2019;s execution in January 1999, the Supreme Court ruled it unconstitutional to kill a man so mentally disabled.<br><br>In 1986, Joseph Roger O&#x2019;Dell was convicted of murder in Virginia despite highly circumstantial evidence from a jailhouse snitch. For twelve years, O&#x2019;Dell sought DNA testing on the forensic evidence, which he claimed would exonerate him, but the courts refused. After his execution on July 23, 1997, the state destroyed the evidence. As a result, its conviction of O&#x2019;Dell could never be scrutinized.<br><br> &#x201c;The reader of this book will be the first &#x2018;jury&#x2019; with access to all the evidence the trial juries never saw,&#x201d; says Prejean, who accompanied both men to their executions. By using the withheld evidence to reconstruct the crimes for which these two men were convicted, Prejean shows how race, prosecutorial ambition, poverty, election cycles, and publicity play far too great a role in determining who dies and who lives.<br><br>Prejean traces the historical underpinnings of executions in this country, demonstrating that it is no accident that over 80 percent of executions in the past twenty-five years have been carried out in the former slave states. She also raises profound constitutional questions about an appeals system that decides most death cases on procedural grounds without ever examining their merits.<br><br>To date, 113 wrongfully convicted persons have been freed from death row. If constitutional protections&#x2013;due process, assistance of counsel, and equal justice under law&#x2013;are truly being respected, how is it possible that these people were convicted in the first place? And how can we accept a system so rife with error?<br><br>Sister Helen Prejean takes us with her on her spiritual journey as she accompanies two possibly innocent human beings to their deaths at the hands of the state. Prejean implores us to reflect on what is perhaps the core moral issue of the death penalty debate: Honorable people disagree about the justice of executing the guilty, but can anyone argue about the injustice of executing the innocent?</p><p>Since the 1993 publication of her memoir <i>Dead Man Walking</i> and the 1995 film it inspired, Sister Helen Prejean has become a powerful and articulate presence in the fight against the death penalty in America. In <i>The Death of Innocents</i>, Prejean focuses her argument on the ways in which an unjust system may be killing innocent people. She tells the story of two inmates she came to know as a spiritual adviser. Dobie Williams, a poor black man with an IQ of 65 from rural Louisiana, was executed after being represented by incompetent counsel and found guilty by an all-white jury based mostly on conjecture and speculation. Joseph O'Dell was convicted of murder after the court heard from an inmate who later admitted to giving false testimony for his own benefit. O'Dell received neither an evidentiary hearing nor potentially exculpatory DNA testing and was executed, insisting on his innocence the whole while. Besides exploring the shaky cases against them, Prejean describes in vivid detail the thoughts and feelings of Williams and O'Dell as their bids for clemency fail and they are put to death. The second part of the book details "the machinery of death," the legal process that Supreme Court Justice Harry Blackmun, dismayed at the inequities of the death penalty, cited as his reason for resigning and that current justice Antonin Scalia has boasted of being a part of. Prejean is impassioned as she describes what she sees as an arrogant attitude by both Scalia and the contemporary judicial system. Her chance confrontation with Scalia at an airport is a gripping collision of disparate worlds. In recent years, DNA testing has overturned the convictions of scores of prisoners, including many on death row. As the death penalty is increasingly called into question, Sister Helen Prejean will surely be a force in that debate. <i>--John Moe</i>Sister Helen Prejean travels extensively, giving, on average, 140 lectures a year, seeking to ignite public discourse on the death penalty. She has appeared on ABC&#x2019;s<i> World News Tonight</i>, <i>60 Minutes, Oprah, </i>NPR, and an NBC special series on capital punishment.

During those bitterly cold four months, the nation is a snow-draped landscape of desolate loneliness and devoid of human activity. Well, not quite. Your name is Charlie Worthing and it&#39;s your first season with the Winter Consuls, the committed but mildly unhinged group of misfits who are responsible for ensuring the hibernatory safe passage of the sleeping masses. You are investigating an outbreak of viral dreams which you dismiss as nonsense; nothing more than a quirky artefact borne of the sleeping mind. When the dreams start to kill people, it&#39;s unsettling. When you get the dreams too, it&#39;s weird. When they start to come true, you begin to doubt your sanity. But teasing truth from Winter is never easy: You have to avoid the Villains and their penchant for murder, kidnapping and stamp collecting, ensure you aren&#39;t eaten by Nightwalkers whose thirst for human flesh can only be satisfied by comfort food, and sidestep the increasingly less-than-mythical WinterVolk. But so long as you remember to wrap up warmly, you&#39;ll be fine.

He has written for a wide range of publications, including <i>Field and Stream</i>, <i>Fly Fisherman</i>, <i>Sports Afield</i>, and <i>Sierra</i>. Camuto is also the book review columnist for <i>Audubon</i> and <i>Gray's Sporting Journal</i> and writes the "Watersheds" column for Trout Unlimited's <i>Trout</i> magazine.A respectfully cross-cultural, profoundly appreciative love letter to the southern Appalachians--the Cherokee Mountains--from Camuto (A Fly Fisherman's Blue Ridge, 1990). Camuto delves into the landscape to get a glimpse of the past and transcend a present in which ``the possibilities of genuine enchantment continually recede.'' For him, that means deep immersion in the Cherokee way of seeing their homeland (though he's smart enough to realize he'll never truly be able to look with Cherokee eyes). He writes not just of his response to the evergreen woods, but of how he understands the Cherokee to have related to them; not only his take on sacred places, but how they figured in the Cherokee cosmology. Camuto is deeply smitten by this ancient, crumpled terrain. He walks long and hard along aboriginal paths in search of wild encounters; tenders intimate, vivid, timeless descriptions of his days afield; leavens the proceedings with historical narratives, natural histories, ethnologies. He limns the good--the Cherokee language and customs, the reintroduction of the red wolf, the improvisational jazz to be found in a veery's song; and the bad--the savagery and sadism of the European conquest, cultural dismemberment, environmental degradation, pauperization of the land's spirit, the loss of native plants and animals, native ideas and images. Camuto's prose can be tortured (describing a pileated woodpecker's ``scalloped flight, a kind of iambic in the air'') and flagging (``De Soto moved on unmoved''). But for the most part it strides quietly and in awe. He beholds a remnant of old growth (``a diorama a bear would have imagined''), reflects on how the red wolf deepens the woods, relishes the pleasures of a campfire. Camuto is humble enough, nimble enough, to sojourn successfully in these mythopoeic climes, conjuring a place portrait of swarming, satisfying complexity. -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

It also shows how sometimes what seems to be in the best interest of all concerned may not apply when one of those concerned is a dog.</p> <p>Wilson&#x2019;s dog, Jack, was an energetic, six-year-old collie that would meet him every day at the trolley station when Wilson returned from work. This was a ritual that had begun when Jack was a pup. The dog knew the route to and from the station like the back of his paw&#x2014;and following that route was the highlight of his day. So when Wilson changed jobs and had to move to California, he thought it best to leave Jack on his home turf in Philadelphia with a relative. He explained all this to the dog upon leaving and told him that they both would have to adjust to new homes.</p> <p>But Jack didn&#x2019;t want a new home. He would not stay with the family he&#x2019;d been left with. He returned to Wilson&#x2019;s old house, even though it was boarded up, and there he passed his solitary days beside an abandoned chair beneath the portico. But every evening, tail wagging, he trotted off to the trolley station. For as long as Jack had been in the world, Wilson had always taken the same trolley home from work, and Jack had been there to greet him. But evening after evening, there was no sign of the devoted dog&#x2019;s master. Confused and sad, he would return alone to the deserted house.</p> <p>The dog&#x2019;s depression grew. He refused the food left for him, and as the days passed, he became thinner and thinner, his ribs noticeable even through his thick blond coat. But every evening, ever hopeful, he&#x2019;d go to the station to meet the trolley. And every evening, he&#x2019;d return to the porch more despondent than before.</p> <p>No one knows why Jack&#x2019;s new family didn&#x2019;t contact Wilson, but Jack&#x2019;s deteriorating condition did not go unnoticed. A friend who lived nearby was so upset by it that he took it upon himself to send a telegram to Wilson in California, informing him of the dog&#x2019;s situation. That was all it took.</p> <p>Wilson bought a return train ticket immediately; he knew what he had to do. Upon arriving in Philadelphia, he waited several hours just so that he could take the same trolley that he always did when coming home. When it arrived at the station, sure enough, there was Jack, waiting and watching as the passengers got off. Looking and hoping. And then suddenly there he was, his beloved owner. His master had returned at last! Jack&#x2019;s world was whole once more&#x2014;and so was Wilson&#x2019;s. Wilson later told Terhune, &#x201c;Jack was sobbing almost like a child might sob. He was shivering all over as if he had a chill. And I? Well, I blew my nose and did a lot of fast winking.&#x201d;</p> <p>Wilson took his devoted dog, Jack, back to California with him. They were never separated again.</p> <p><strong>-Hester Mundis</strong></p> <p>�2005. All rights reserved. Reprinted from <i>Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul</i>.

By the author of The Holes in Your Nose.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: JapaneseYagyu (The Holes in Your Nose, 1994, etc.) focuses on another part of the body that doesn't get much attention from adults, in a book that was first published in Japan in 1982. The narrator compares his feet to those of adults, to apes' feet, and to horses' hooves. An interesting nugget for readers to take away is the image of a foot having treads, like sneakers or tires; a sequence drawing shows in ``stop motion'' how a runner's foot hits the ground (heel, whole foot, toe). The simple line drawings, plain colors, and design recall old titles in the Let's-Read-and-Find-Out series--utilitarian at best. Two pages invite readers to make foot tracings and foot prints, enticements that may limit the book's longevity in school or public libraries.

It has been a fortnight since the battle&#x2014;a mere two weeks, yet it feels like two thousand years. Below me the city smolders. The factories no longer produce, and the streets no longer bustle with Atlantia&#x2019;s fortunate citizens, who so recently went about their business, blissfully secure in the guarantee of safety and prosperity.<br> <br>Safety purchased at an unspeakable cost.<br> <br>The rats who dwelled here were not directly to blame; they were ignorant to all of it. But then, if they never thought to wonder or investigate, do they not share a fraction of the guilt? The Atlantian citizens only knew that their emperor, Titus, had arranged a peace accord with the feral cats that provided the rodents with comfortable lives and untroubled minds. They never bothered to ask the true cost of that peace.<br> <br>Now the city is overrun with the refugees who would have been sacrificed to keep the ferals from preying upon Atlantia. These were mice and rats and squirrels and chipmunks found wandering in the subway tunnels by Titus&#x2019;s soldiers and offered up to the feral queen in exchange for peace. These are the ones who were liberated from Titus&#x2019;s death camps and have now taken up a precarious residence behind Atlantia&#x2019;s once-impenetrable walls.<br> <br>The rebels acted in good faith when they liberated the camps, but the results are grim. It must be said: they did not think far enough into the future. They were so determined to end the tyranny that they never considered what would happen in the aftermath. Such small crusaders are they! Such high hopes they had! And I count myself among them.<br> <br>When this rebellion began, long ago, the goal was for all creatures to coexist in peace. A true peace in which we would aid one another, regardless of our species, as we struggled against the daily strife that comes of being tiny and hunted, or far from home and hungry. Of being loved once and then forgotten, turned out, abandoned. For this is the condition of the poor souls who find their way here, to the belly of the earth.<br> <br>At the heart of this campaign was the belief we could learn to refrain from preying upon one another. Alas, I see now that this may have been too much to hope for. Because I have come to understand that even in the presence of justice and fairness, nature overrides all. Hunger must be fed, and nature has designed us so that such instinct and need can rarely be entirely quelled. I have learned that there is no evil in the true course of nature, there is only what must be. We form a living chain, from the enormous humans who dominate the upland world to the most humble creatures among us&#x2014;rodent, insect, reptile.<br> <br>The so-called peace that Titus brokered was self-serving and entirely against nature&#x2014;animals were taken randomly from this life before nature deemed it their rightful time. There is no denying that to each of us who walks or hops or crawls or slithers upon this earth or under it, there will ultimately come that moment when we must bid our farewells and breathe our last breath. But what form our exit will take is for nature and destiny, not government, to decide. Nature determines what will come and when it will come, and how. That is the great mystery of being.<br> <br>Titus upset that fragile balance by attempting to outwit nature, and now all that he twisted and manipulated must be repaired.<br> <br>Below me the blare of a horn rips through the smoky silence. I recognize it well. In the past the rebel Firren would use this horn to summon her Rangers in a secret call to arms. Now the horn is a warning, and the few rodents who have been scurrying amid the city&#x2019;s shambles&#x2014;looting, scavenging, begging&#x2014;scamper off hastily to conceal themselves behind crumbling walls.<br> <br>&#x201c;Incoming,&#x201d; a guard&#x2019;s voice bellows. &#x201c;Ferals approaching. Seek cover!&#x201d;<br> <br>I watch in horror as one young mouse, who has been hauling a wagon filled with rotting food scraps, freezes in his tracks in the middle of Atlantia&#x2019;s town square. My heart breaks to see him trembling and unprotected there in plain sight. I wish I could run to him, or at the very least shout out a command for him to run away. But to reveal myself would wreak even more havoc on this forsaken place. I must bide my time and do what I can from the shadows.<br> <br>Two feral cats stalk into view. They are new to the tunnels, I am sure, for they still have a sense of upland scruff about them. They must be recent additions to Felina&#x2019;s ranks; I can see in their eyes that they remember daylight. And this makes them even more dangerous, because beneath their hunger lurks the need to prove themselves.<br> <br>The larger of the two felines is reaching out to slam one heavy paw down on the cowering mouse, when from the corner of my eye I spot a flash of silver, a blur of blue and red.<br> <br>She is here! The rebel warrior. With her she brings a royal heir.<br> <br>And a Chosen One.<br> <br>He is the smallest among them, this Chosen One, but he is first to attack. Sword drawn, he barrels toward the startled cats, crying out in a familiar call: &#x201c;Aye, aye, aye!&#x201d; He swiftly delivers a warning cut to the larger cat&#x2019;s hind leg. As the cat yowls and sputters, the petite rebel in her silver cape catches hold of the other villain&#x2019;s tail and sinks her sharp rat teeth into it. The bitten one hisses and roars.<br> <br>Now the royal heir steps forward, brandishing a dagger.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d really rather not kill you two,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s been far too much bloodshed already. But I will if I must.&#x201d;<br> <br>The larger cat licks a trickle of red from his leg and speaks with an upland accent. &#x201c;We gotta eat,&#x201d; he says in his own defense.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, do it elsewhere,&#x201d; says the Chosen One. &#x201c;These citizens of Atlantia are under our protection.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Citizens?&#x201d; The cat snorts. He shifts a yellowy glance toward the refugees, who peek out from their hiding places. &#x201c;They ain&#x2019;t citizens, they&#x2019;re squatters. Rodent rejects. They&#x2019;re feline food.&#x201d;<br> <br>At that the Chosen One raises his sword. &#x201c;Not while there&#x2019;s breath in my body, they aren&#x2019;t!&#x201d;<br> <br>Then the rebel plants her hind legs and rests one ready paw on the handle of her sword. She makes no other move, just waits with coiled fury. The ferals sense immediately how very much she&#x2019;d enjoy plunging that blade right between their eyes. The royal heir simply crooks a grin and spins his dagger between his claws in a showy gesture. The message is clear: he, too, is prepared to fight.<br> <br>Then the little warrior draws himself up; the words he speaks are ground out between his tiny mouse teeth. &#x201c;Be gone,&#x201d; he orders. &#x201c;Or die.&#x201d;<br> <br>The ferals hesitate only a moment before turning to run back the way they came.<br> <br>From my perch above Atlantia, a feeling swells up within me, a warm sensation that prickles along my fur. It is pride. And hope.<br> <br>Now the Chosen One rushes toward the quivering victim, who is still huddled in the middle of the dusty square; he sweeps him into his arms.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay,&#x201d; he says in a gentle voice. &#x201c;They can&#x2019;t hurt you now.&#x201d;<br> <br>The mouse wriggles free and regards the hero with a sneer. &#x201c;Of course they can! Don&#x2019;t you see? We&#x2019;re doomed. You&#x2019;ve solved nothing. You&#x2019;ve failed!&#x201d;<br> <br>With that, the mouse runs off, leaving his cart behind.<br> <br>The Chosen One turns to his friends, his eyes moist and his whiskers twitching. They know that the mouse&#x2019;s words ring with the prevailing sentiment of all who still dwell here. The suffering rodents feel no gratitude. They give no credit to the Chosen One and the rebels for trying; instead they place blame for falling short.<br> <br>With the weight of this knowledge pressing heavily on my heart, I bow my head and slink away.<br> <br>As Hopper watched the last of the crickets spring away from the palace, he was reminded of the one that had played a delightfully impromptu concert for him on that first dark day when he&#x2019;d awoken and found himself in the tunnels. A lifetime ago, it seemed.<br> <br>At the height of the rebel invasion this writhing swarm of insects had, at Firren&#x2019;s command, attached itself to the sprawling palace and transformed it into a prison, where the emperor Titus had been contained these past two weeks. Hopper had not seen Titus since the bugs had sealed him within the beautiful palace, but he could imagine the craggy old rat at turns pacing in fury over his imprisonment, then dissolving into weeping fits, grieving the loss of his city and mourning the end of his regime.<br> <br>And maybe&#x2014;just maybe&#x2014;lamenting the wickedness of his death deal with Felina.<br> <br>Today the crickets had been relieved of their duties; they had been ordered to take their leave by Firren, who now stood before the palace with Hopper and Prince Zucker.<br> <br>Hopper was still smarting from the insult delivered by the mouse in the town square. The resentment in those little black eyes stung more than any battle wound Hopper had endured. Did he really deserve such contempt?<br> <br>As he looked around at the waste and the chaos, it was hard to be sure that he didn&#x2019;t. Most of the grand buildings of Atlantia had been stormed by rodents desperate for shelter. Some had been set ablaze and were still smoldering. The stalls and carts of the market were toppled and broken, and the streets were filled with litter of all sorts. Nearly everything of value had been stolen, swept out of the city in the exodus, and the rodents who remained cowered in their hiding places or crept through the city with frightened expressions on their gaunt faces.<br> <br>Zucker, who always seemed to know what Hopper was thinking, laid a gentle paw on the Chosen One&#x2019;s shoulder. &#x201c;These are confusing times, kid,&#x201d; he said softly. &#x201c;You did what you had to do. We all did.&#x201d;<br> <br>Hopper sighed. &#x201c;But we never expected this.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure what we expected,&#x201d; Zucker admitted. &#x201c;All we knew was that those refugee camps had to be eradicated and Titus had to be stopped.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;In that regard we&#x2019;ve succeeded,&#x201d; said Firren.<br> <br>Zucker grinned. &#x201c;And now, like after any good party, somebody&#x2019;s gotta clean up.&#x201d;<br> <br>Hopper shook his head. &#x201c;It wasn&#x2019;t a party.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I know, kid. I&#x2019;m just trying to inject a little levity.&#x201d;<br> <br>Hopper supposed he was grateful for the prince&#x2019;s attempt at lightening the mood. He was not looking forward to what was about to happen.<br> <br>With a deep breath he focused his gaze on the tall, wide doors of the palace. A moment later the soldiers Bartel and Pritchard appeared from inside, pausing at the threshold. They were young, sturdy rats, impressively decked out in the uniform of Zucker&#x2019;s private guard&#x2014;purple tunics embroidered with a silver Z over the heart. In a way it was Hopper who had first recruited them to duty when he&#x2019;d enlisted their assistance in retrieving a wounded Zucker from the tunnels.<br> <br>&#x201c;Come along,&#x201d; Bartel called over his shoulder. &#x201c;The prince, the Chosen One, and the rebel leader await.&#x201d;<br> <br>There was a slow shuffling sound as Titus emerged from the palace. When the disgraced emperor stepped into view, Hopper&#x2019;s breath caught in his throat. Even Zucker, who had more reason than anyone to harbor a deep, unrelenting anger toward the old rat, had to look away.<br> <br>This once-formidable rat sovereign, who mere weeks ago had sat upon a gilded throne and ruled a prosperous underground kingdom, was little more than a shriveled shadow of his former self. His broad shoulders were hunched, and the heft he&#x2019;d once carried was gone. He seemed deflated, a sack of wrinkled skin and bones.<br> <br>&#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t they feed him in there?&#x201d; Hopper whispered to Zucker.<br> <br>&#x201c;They tried.&#x201d; The prince gave a grim shake of his head. &#x201c;He wouldn&#x2019;t eat.&#x201d;<br> <br>Even at this distance Hopper could see that Titus&#x2019;s eyes no longer burned with keen intellect; now they were sunken, vacant, and afraid. His paws trembled, his whiskers drooped. In places his fur had gone from iron gray to dull white. Worst was the pinkish welt of a scar that snaked across his face. If it had been unappealing before, it was downright ghoulish now, standing out from the sagging flesh of his snout more than it ever had before.<br> <br>&#x201c;Step lively,&#x201d; Pritchard said. &#x201c;And mind the stairs.&#x201d;</p><h2>Murder in the Executive Mansion</h2><p>On the trail of the killer of one of her aides, First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt is shocked to discover a German spy ring working inside the White House, just as America is poised on the brink of World War II</p><p>The posthumously published 15th in Roosevelt's series starring his mother Eleanor as sleuth finds the White House in an uproar before a visit from King George VI and Queen Elizabeth. At the 11th hour, Lucinda Robinson, Eleanor's social secretary, goes missing. Only after the royal couple leaves is her body discovered, stuffed in a third-floor closet. Eleanor enlists her old investigative pals, D.C. police captain Ed Kennelly and Secret Service agent Gerald Baines, to pursue the killer. They discover that Lucinda was a complex woman, fluent in German, ambitious, playful and sexually active. As they search, Eleanor goes undercover, masquerading as Detective Broderick when she visits a "carpet joint" (a nightclub with gambling) and sees a striptease act. Soon the First Lady suspects a connection between FDR's preoccupation with the German threat and Lucinda's fascination with that country. The author's fans will relish this glimpse into White House life of the time and the parade of famous names. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc."Eleanor the private eye is utterly endearing." --<i>The New York Times</i><br></p><h2>Hottest Mess (SIN)</h2><p>The S.I.N. series continues with the seductive follow-up to the Stark International Novel <i>Dirtiest Secret, </i>from the <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author of &#x201c;red-hot and angsty&#x201d; fiction that &#x201c;keeps readers guessing&#x201d; (<i>Publishers Weekly, </i>on <i>Under My Skin</i>).<br><br><i><b>No one can know about our love&#x2014;and hiding only makes it hotter.</b></i><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> Dallas Sykes has a reputation.

Here, my body had been adored. My skin stroked. My blood had burned with a passion that had been building over seventeen long years. I&#x2019;d been touched and kissed and worshipped by the man I&#x2019;ve loved my entire life, and I&#x2019;d relished the freedom to explore every inch of him in return. My lips on his strong jaw, his tight abs. My tongue tasting the sweetness of his skin and the saltiness of his cock.<br><br>We made love tenderly, then violently, then tenderly once more. We curled together in each other&#x2019;s arms. We watched late night television with our legs twined, until the sensation of skin against skin overwhelmed us and we muted the drone of talk show hosts, and explored each other again in the flickering light of the television.<br><br>We swam naked in the pool during the day, then walked along the beach in the moonlight.<br><br>Those days had been a gift.

Don&#x2019;t tell me that you don&#x2019;t&#x2014;�wait.&#x201d; She tilts her head, studying me, and as I watch, her eyes go wide, and she presses four long fingers over her blood-�red lips. &#x201c;Oh, shit. I&#x2019;m sorry. I didn&#x2019;t&#x2014;�&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t what?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t recognize you. You&#x2019;re Jane, right? You&#x2019;re his sister. God, that was totally lame of me.&#x201d; She drags her perfectly manicured fingers through her pixie-�style hair. &#x201c;I just saw you looking at him, and I assumed that you&#x2014;�anyway, never mind.&#x201d; She draws a deep breath and extends her hand. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Fiona. Did I mention I&#x2019;m an idiot?&#x201d;<br><br>I can&#x2019;t help but laugh. &#x201c;Honest mistake. Really. I was looking at him. But that was irritation you were seeing. Not lust.&#x201d; That, at least, is half true, and I allow myself one deep breath in relief. Crisis averted. Bullet dodged.<br><br>But I&#x2019;d be lying if I didn&#x2019;t admit that some tiny, screwed up part of me wishes that she&#x2019;d called my bluff. That she&#x2019;d felt the heat that burns in my veins for him&#x2014;�and that she&#x2019;d figured it out.<br><br>Because as much as I love Dallas, I hate that we have to hide. And some rebellious, hidden, bold, stupid part of me wishes that we could be open and out there and real.<br><br>We can&#x2019;t, though. I know we can&#x2019;t. The law and our parents and the threat of public humiliation keep us trapped firmly in the shadows. And, honestly, I&#x2019;ve never been too fond of the spotlight, so the idea of having tabloid attention focused on me because I&#x2019;m sleeping with my brother really doesn&#x2019;t sit well.<br><br>But it&#x2019;s not just family and privacy and social mores that are keeping us apart. There&#x2019;s Deliverance, too. Because as long as Dallas is Top Secret Vigilante Guy, everything in his life is going to remain hidden, including the man he truly is. A man so very different from the one he shows the public. A man that even I don&#x2019;t fully know or understand, because we haven&#x2019;t yet talked about how Deliverance operates or about its core mission to track&#x2014;�and presumably kill&#x2014;�the miserable excuses for human beings who kidnapped us both seventeen years ago. We need to, of course, but neither of us wanted that conversation to intrude on our four days of bliss. We only wanted each other.<br><br>&#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; Fiona says, her forehead creasing as she peers at me. &#x201c;You okay?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Fine.&#x201d; I force a smile, even though I feel like crying. Because for the first time it&#x2019;s fully hit me. He&#x2019;s mine. Dallas Sykes is absolutely, one hundred percent, totally mine.<br><br>And yet I can never truly have him.<br><br>Not in the way that counts. Not in the way that matters.<br><br>We&#x2019;re living a lie that is shiny and perfect and wonderful in the shadows, but that shrivels and dies in the harsh light of day.<br><br>I love him. I do.<br><br>And even though we promised each other that we would make this work, I can&#x2019;t help but fear that&#x2019;s a promise we never should have made. Because it&#x2019;s a promise that is impossible to keep.<br><br>2<br><br>Rear Window<br><br>An hour later I&#x2019;m finally alone and on my third bourbon. Fiona has overcompensated for her faux pas by prattling on about nothing and everything, which was good in that her constant attention kept my eyes from drifting to Dallas.<br><br>And bad, in that her constant attention kept my eyes from drifting to Dallas.<br><br>Even knowing I shouldn&#x2019;t, all I want to do is watch him. And imagine him touching me. And seethe about the fact that he is spending the party touching everyone but me.<br><br>Apparently, he&#x2019;s even touched Fiona.<br><br>&#x201c;We went out a couple of times,&#x201d; she told me, eyes sparkling. &#x201c;Everyone knows he hardly ever sees the same woman twice, but, well, he saw me three times.&#x201d; Her lips curved wickedly. &#x201c;He saw all of me.&#x201d;<br><br>My stomach twisted as I smiled politely and said something about my brother&#x2019;s reputation and how I really needed to go take care of something with the staff. I escaped inside, hid out for half an hour, and when I returned, I didn&#x2019;t see her at all.<br><br>Dallas, however, caught my attention right away.<br><br>Now, I&#x2019;m leaning against the corner post of one of the pool cabanas trying not to watch him. Or, at least, trying not to be obvious about the fact that I&#x2019;m watching him.<br><br>He&#x2019;s moved on from the blonde. Now he stands next to a brunette with streaks of neon blue. Her long hair falls in loose curls over her back, bare in the designer halter she wears. She sports a tattoo on her shoulder&#x2014;�not a feminine one, but a skull against a blood-�red background.<br><br>She wears a black leather miniskirt and five-�inch heels, and I have no doubt that this is a woman who takes what she wants. I can tell simply from looking at her. I can also tell from the way she keeps leaning toward Dallas and running her tongue over the edge of his ear.<br><br>I&#x2019;ve never met the woman, but I&#x2019;m going out on a limb and saying that I don&#x2019;t like her. Not at all. Not even one little bit.<br><br>I realize I&#x2019;m staring again, and so I pull out my phone and make an effort to go through my emails. The attempt is futile&#x2014;�I see words, but they make no sense to me at the moment.<br><br>At least not until a text message flashes across my screen.<br><br>Watch.<br><br>It&#x2019;s from Dallas, of course, and my body tightens merely from seeing his name. I react on instinct&#x2014;�my head lifting, my eyes going straight to where he stands with Skull Girl. He&#x2019;s not looking in my direction, but I know that he is aware of me. He always is. Just as I&#x2019;m always aware of him.<br><br>I stand, my feet like weights holding me in place as I watch the scene unfolding in front of me. Dallas and the woman standing near the pool, chatting casually with a few of the guests. Dallas&#x2019;s hand, brushing lightly against her bare back. His fingers trailing down her spine, then over the halter&#x2019;s tie at her waist.<br><br>I expect his hand to stroke the soft leather and cup her ass, but that isn&#x2019;t what happens. Instead, his nimble fingers unfasten the button of her waistband, loosening it just enough so that he can slip his hand inside her skirt and slide it down over her ass. For just a fraction of an instant, he looks up, his eyes finding mine. Heat pours through me, turning me liquid, making me wet.<br><br>I know what he is doing&#x2014;�we&#x2019;ve done this before. Him touching another woman. Me watching. And both of us pretending that he is touching me.<br><br>The first time, it was hotter than sin. I&#x2019;d been alone in a bathroom, watching the scenario play out on video. We weren&#x2019;t together yet&#x2014;�in fact we were doing everything to stay apart&#x2014;�and that moment had been a turning point for both of us. A bold&#x2014;�albeit completely fucked up&#x2014;�statement of just how badly we wanted each other.

Alma Ross&#39;s story first came to public attention through the intriguing 1980 film Playing for Time. The true story of this heroic woman is now told for the first time. Rose was born to musical royalty in Vienna when the imperial city was the center of the musical world. Her father was violinist and concertmaster Arnold Rose; her uncle was Gustav Mahler. In the 1930s she founded and led a brilliant womens touring orchestra. Like many other Viennese Jews, the Rose family was caught off guard by the rise of Nazism. Alma assisted her family to flee but was herself caught and deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau. There, Alma again formed and led a women&#39;s orchestra---the only women&#39;s musical ensemble in the Nazi camps---thereby saving the lives of some four dozen women. In telling Alma&#39;s full story, the authors honor her and the valiant prisoner-musicians for whom music meant life.</p><p>Part family biography, part European and Holocaust history, this book traces the life of violinist Alma Ros�, along with that of other members of her illustrious musical family, from her birth in 1906 in one of the world's foremost cultural capitals to her death in a Nazi extermination camp in 1944. It will be particularly fascinating and wrenching to anyone with similar roots. Alma was the niece of the famous composer and conductor Gustav Mahler, at the time director of the Vienna Opera, and the daughter of Arnold Ros�, concertmaster of the Opera Orchestra and the Vienna Philharmonic and leader of his own renowned string quartet. Her older brother Alfred became a noted pianist, conductor, composer, and teacher. Alma, named after her aunt and godmother, Alma Mahler, was taught by her father and, both inspired and intimidated by the family's musical tradition, she became a fairly successful violinist. <p> In 1930, she established a girls' orchestra called the Viennese Waltz-Girls, with which she toured throughout Europe as conductor and soloist, and which surprisingly had her austere father's blessing because of the high quality of the playing. Her marriage to the famous, dashing Czech violin virtuoso V�sa Pr�hoda soon ended in heartbreak and divorce. Disaster struck in 1938, when Hitler annexed Austria, whose population welcomed him enthusiastically; the country's always latent anti-Semitism erupted swiftly and violently. Though the Ros� family were completely assimilated and had even converted to Christianity, Arnold immediately lost his orchestra position and pension. His wife was ill and died that year, leaving him stranded financially and emotionally. Alfred and his wife managed to flee to Holland, England, and eventually Canada, where he died in 1975; Alma mistakenly thought she was protected by the Czech passport gained through her marriage. With dauntless determination, and with the help of old friends, including the famous violinist Carl Flesch, she got her father and herself to England only months before the outbreak of World War II. The Ros� Quartet's cellist and former principal of the Vienna Philharmonic, Friedrich Buxbaum, had arrived there earlier; he later joined the re-formed quartet.</p><p> So far, Alma's story parallels my own. Born in Vienna 20 years later to musical parents who encouraged my violin studies, I grew up near enough the Ros� house to encounter the illustrious concertmaster not only on stage but on the streetcar. We witnessed Hitler's triumphant arrival, but our Czech passports enabled us to escape to Czechoslovakia. When Hitler caught up with us in 1939, we, too, managed with the help of friends to get to England just before the war. A few years later, I was thrilled to be the violinist in a trio with the venerable Buxbaum, who still played with the facility and tone of a man half his age. Here the resemblance ends. While we survived the war in England and ultimately came to America, Alma was tempted by performing opportunities to leave the comparative security of England for Holland, where her career flourished and she earned enough money to help her father. </p><p> She was still fulfilling engagements when the Germans overran Belgium and the Netherlands; her efforts to get back to England, or join her brother in America, failed. Staying with friends, she was almost picked up by the Nazis despite a hastily arranged marriage to an "Aryan" Dutchman, and in 1942 she went into hiding, tried to get into Switzerland, but was betrayed, arrested, and deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau. </p><p> From here on, the story takes on a surreal character. Shortly after her arrival at what has been called "a wound in the order of being," it was discovered that Alma was a violinist, and, in a grotesque replay of her past, she was asked to take over a poor, threadbare musical ensemble of women inmates. By sheer courage, fortitude, and determination, she turned this motley group into a viable orchestra, training and coaching the players; arranging music for its ill-matched instrumental makeup, from mandolins to sopranos; and driving herself and her musicians to exhaustion. Gaining unprecedented stature and exploiting some of the most brutal camp functionaries' love of music, she saved her musicians from the gas chambers and also obtained some favors and privileges for them. Forty years later, one of them said that there is not a day when she does not remember Alma and thank her. Alma herself succumbed to an undiagnosed illness, which deepened the mystery surrounding her.</p><p> Author Richard Newman made friends with Alfred Ros� and his wife in Canada in 1946. The impetus for writing this book was the publication of a memoir called <i>Playing for Time</i> by Fania F�nelon, a singer with Alma's orchestra, which gives a very harsh portrayal of her. Newman's search for the "real" Alma lasted 22 years and took him around the world. His sources are family letters, interviews, and correspondence with family, friends, and surviving members of the orchestra, lending the book an overwhelming immediacy and authenticity. Included are Mahler and Ros� family trees, many pages of photographs, a map of Auschwitz-Birkenau, and a list of the orchestra players. The section dealing with camp life (and death) is written in an unemotional, reportorial style full of facts and figures. That approach may have saved Newman's own sanity, and, by its incongruity with the grisly content, it both blunts and heightens the impact of the indescribable, unimaginable details it recounts. This is a book to numb the mind and sear the soul. <i>--Edith Eisler</i></p>Art endures despite great adversity. Never was that more true than in the case of Alma Rose. Ardent, impetuous, and inspiring, Alma is the subject of a new biography that tells her full story. In telling Alma&#x2019;s story, Richard Newman and Karen Kirtley honor her and the valiant prisoner-musicians for whom music meant life.</p><h2>Lewis Hamilton: My Story: Special Celebration Edition</h2><p>An iconic visual celebration of Lewis Hamilton&#39;s historic Formula One World Championship winning season, including the story of his life to date and exclusive new words and pictures from a dramatic year. Welcome to the world of Britain&#39;s hottest sports celebrity, as told by Lewis himself. Lewis Hamilton: Formula One World Drivers&#39; Champion. It is hard to believe that Lewis, at 23, has only just completed his second year of Formula One and has already joined the pantheon of select great British sporting legends. My Story -- his incredible first-person account of his life, from karting champion and rookie boy-racer to Formula One driver for one of the biggest and most prestigious grand prix racing teams -- has now been fully updated and lavishly repackaged in an illustrated format, with new colour photographs and stories from the 2008 season.From the perfect start in Melbourne, through the controversy in Montreal and Spa, to the memorable victories of Silverstone and Shanghai, and finally the unbelievable stomach-churning climax in Sao Paolo and the unprecedented celebrations that followed -- it&#39;s all here, hot off the press just four weeks on from his record-breaking title victory, and in Lewis&#39;s own words.</p><p>Lewis Hamilton was born in Stevenage, Hertfordshire in January 1985. By the age of eight he was racing karts, at ten he drove to his first British championship, and at thirteen he was signed to the McLaren team. He made his F1 debut for at the 2007 Australian GP and was crowned the youngest-ever Formula One World Drivers&#39; Champion in 2008 at the age of 23 -- and the first British champion since Damon Hill in 1996. His family include his father Anthony, step-mother Linda, mother Carmen and brother Nic.</p><h2>Why Me</h2><p>Having unsuspectingly lifted the hottest rock in town, John Dortmunder is the prey of the FBI, the New York City police, terrorist groups from three nations, and all of New York&#39;s petty and not-so-petty crooks</p><p>DONALD E. WESTLAKE has written numerous novels over the past thirty-five years under his own name and pseudonyms, including Richard Stark. Many of his books have been made into movies, including The Hunter, which became the brilliant film noir Point Blank, and the 1999 smash hit Payback.

He lives with his wife, Abby Adams, in rural New York State.</p><h2>The Last Lincoln Conspirator: John Surratt&#39;s Flight from the Gallows</h2><p>Despite all that has been written about the April 1865 assassination of President Abraham Lincoln, the story of John Surratt--the only conspirator who got away--remains untold and largely unknown. The capture and shooting of John Wilkes Booth twelve days after he shot Lincoln is a well-known and well-covered story. The fate of the eight other accomplices of Booth has also been widely written about. Four, including Surratt's mother, Mary, were convicted and hanged, and four were jailed. John Surratt alone managed to evade capture for twenty months and escape punishment once he was put on trial. In this tale of adventure and mystery, Andrew Jampoler tells what happened to that last conspirator, who after Booth's death became the most wanted man in America.<p>As the first full-length treatment of Surratt's escape, capture, and trial, the book provides fascinating details about his flight from New York, where he was on a Confederate spy mission scouting the huge Union prisoner of war camp in Elmira, through eastern Canada to a hideout in Liverpool, England, and on to France and the Papal States. His twenty-month flight, including nearly one year of enlisted service in the Papal Zouaves (the pope's army), is a remarkable adventure through mid-century Europe and locations unknown to most Americans of the time. Despite an uncontrollable tendency to babble to strangers about who he really was and what he had done, Surratt, frequently sheltered by sympathetic Roman Catholic priests, managed to stay at large during a flight that took him across three continents and over the Atlantic Ocean and half the Mediterranean Sea. Finally caught in Alexandria, Egypt, he was returned to Washington to stand trial in 1867.</p><p>Jampoler brings Surratt to life as he traces the wily young man's remarkable journey and the bitter legal proceedings against him that bizarrely led to his freedom. After his trial, Surratt lived out his life peacefully in Baltimore, marrying a relative of Francis Scott Key and dying at the age of seventy-two. The book's cast of characters includes a menagerie of the nineteenth century's most colorful personalities.</p></p><p><b>ANDREW C.A.

Now Spartan is coming to Heatland. He&#39;s not the same horse and he&#39;s filled with an anger that seems directed at Amy. At the sight of her, he lashes out - teeth bared, hooves flailing.</p><p>Amy Fleming is a talented young rider and horse trainer whose mother recently died while trying to rescue an abandoned stallion. Amy's mom was a famous horse trainer who founded Heartland, a horse-training center for abused, neglected, and problem horses. In the weeks following her mother's death, Amy, her older sister Lou, and their grandpa try to cope with the sudden loss of the woman who was the heart of Heartland, but they're overwhelmed by the pressures of running the horse farm while dealing with their grief. Fifteen-year-old Amy focuses on training Spartan, the horse she and her mom were trying to rescue, and achieves spectacular results as he turns out to be a talented jumper. Lou tries to take over the business side of the farm, but Amy fights every change she tries to make, even though Heartland needs Lou's guidance and business sense to survive. Over the course of the summer, Amy and Lou learn to respect each other's talents and contributions, and they strike a new balance that will enable Heartland to continue its work of "healing horses, healing hearts."<p> Horse lovers who liked the movie <i>The Horse Whisperer</i> will appreciate the descriptions of training methods and alternative therapies used at Heartland. Young readers who enjoy the Saddle Club, Pine Hollow, and Thoroughbred series of horse stories will also like the Heartland series, which began with <i>Coming Home</i>.

This classic in feminist literature provides an account of women&#39;s creativity in every age from pre-history to the present, and attempts to view women&#39;s roles in the context of the total time span of human experience. In clear and elegant prose, the author takes us on a breathtaking tour through time: we move through the hundred-thousand-year wanderings of the Paleolithic into the great transition from hunting and gathering to herding and planting; from life inside city walls to the great primary civilizations of the Middle East and Asia, as well as the feudal civilizations on its fringes; and from the sweep of culture generated by the Greco-Romanic-Islamic empires to &#34;European Enlightenment&#34; and, finally, to the last two centuries and the gradual industrialization-urbanization of the planet. New to this volume is a look at the 20th century women&#39;s movement--including a chapter on Third World women--as well as a provocative epilogue entitled &#34;Creating Futures for the 21st Century.&#34; When we look at the imbalances regarding women in the social record, we are not simply gleaning information about the status of women: we are getting clues about general imbalances within society at large. For this reason, students, professionals, and practitioners alike will find The Underside of History to be an invigorating intellectual exercise and an essential addition to their libraries. &#34;It is a classic, in all meaningsof the word. This book contains a lot of important information and shows us how to re-vision history and historical data. It won&#39;t &#39;scare&#39; men or newcomers to women&#39;s studies.&#34; --Elizabeth Moen, University of Colorado, Boulder &#34;Its presentation of this &#39;forgotten&#39; history is irreplaceable. This book is a treasure house of detail and stories which should not be lost. In addition, it is extremely well written.&#34; --Joanna Macy &#34;For anyone teaching gender courses at college or in other education centers, this book is most useful since each chapter gives a complete overview of the question and is followed by a very thorough bibliography which proves very useful.&#34; --Andree Michel, Ministere de l&#39;Education Nationale, Centre National De La Recherche Scientifique, Paris &#34;No other book that I know of covers so much.

Isolated and alone, the young boy begins to cry and his tears awaken the ancient god Gonn-Ben-Allah, Keeper of the Ghosts of the Lost Names, who lies beneath the sand.</p><p>Rising to full form for the first time in tens of thousands of years, the majestic Gonn tells his frightened savior that fate has brought them together. To comfort Ahmed, the god bestows the gift of flight upon the boy, and the pair sets off on an evening of spectacular adventures. Traveling through time and space, Gonn shows the fascinated Ahmed the wonders of the world-past and present-and its sorrows. Within each startling revelation, Ahmed finds wisdom-and learns to accept life for all it has to offer.</p><p>A wondrous fable for children of all ages, AHMED AND THE OBLIVION MACHINES is yet another glorious testament to the remarkable gifts of master storyteller Ray Bradbury.</p></p><p><p>In a career spanning more than seventy years, Ray Bradbury, who died on June 5, 2011 at the age of 91, inspired generations of readers to dream, think, and create. A prolific author of hundreds of short stories and close to fifty books, as well as numerous poems, essays, operas, plays, teleplays, and screenplays, Bradbury was one of the most celebrated writers of our time. His groundbreaking works include <em>Fahrenheit 451</em>, <em>The Martian Chronicles</em>, <em>The Illustrated Man</em>, <em>Dandelion Wine</em>, and <em>Something Wicked This Way Comes</em>. He wrote the screen play for John Huston's classic film adaptation of <em>Moby Dick</em>, and was nominated for an Academy Award. He adapted sixty-five of his stories for television's <em>The Ray Bradbury Theater</em>, and won an Emmy for his teleplay of <em>The Halloween Tree</em>. He was the recipient of the 2000 National Book Foundation Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters, the 2004 National Medal of Arts, and the 2007 Pulitzer Prize Special Citation, among many honors.</p><p>Throughout his life, Bradbury liked to recount the story of meeting a carnival magician, Mr. Electrico, in 1932. At the end of his performance Electrico reached out to the twelve-year-old Bradbury, touched the boy with his sword, and commanded, "Live forever!" Bradbury later said, "I decided that was the greatest idea I had ever heard. I started writing every day. I never stopped."</p>From Bradbury (for adults, Quicker Than the Eye, 1996, etc.), a fantasy with moments of brilliance swamped by mystical befuddlement. Ahmed, a young boy, gets lost in a sand storm while trekking across the desert with his father's caravan. He stumbles on a gigantic buried statue, which his tears awaken. The statue is an ancient god, Gonn-Ben-Allah, Keeper of the Ghost of Lost Names. Gonn-Ben-Allah takes Ahmed through space and time, tracing the history of human efforts to fly (an analogy for the ability to imagine and invent). Bradbury is at his best when he describes past flyers who tried and failed; pterosaurs are called ``boney kites'' and a balloon is described ``as ripe as a peach.'' There's also an aviator, a collector of butterflies who sewed up ``a thousand small bright wings''a captivating imagethat attempts flight. Ahmed takes in all that Gonn-Ben-Allah shows him, and when the god ``dies,'' Ahmed follows in the deity's footsteps, becoming a flyer himself. The exotic setting is exhilarating, although Gonn's ornate speech comes across as puffed-up posturing, often stalling the plot and sidelining the story's purpose. Clearly labeled a fable, the tale has instruction built into most passages, but those passages are occasionally breathtaking.

Peter Wake, USN, is a veteran of Office of Naval Intelligence operations inside Spanish-occupied Cuba, who describes with vivid detail his experiences as a naval liaison ashore with the Cuban and U.S. armies in the jungles, hospitals, headquarters, and battlefields in the 1898 campaign to capture Santiago de Cuba from the Spanish. His younger friend, and former superior, Theodore Roosevelt, is included in Wake's story, as the two of them endure the hell of war in the tropics.<br><br>Wake's account of the military campaign ashore is a window into the woeful incompetence, impressive innovations, energy-sapping frustration, and breathtaking bravery that is always at the heart of combat. His description of the great naval battle, from the unique viewpoint of a prisoner onboard the most famous Spanish warship, is an emotional rendering of how the concept of honor can transform a hopeless cause into a noble gesture of humanity. Honoring the Enemy is the fourteenth book in the award-winning Honor Series of historical naval novels.</p><p>Robert N.

The military, operational intelligence, and technical acumen of the well-known author are exceedingly formidable. The accompanying sketch maps are illustrative and necessary, something too often missing in many books. The Spanish are portrayed as honorable adversaries fighting a losing battle. Small, surprising and arcane historical details abound. Macomber's work is filled with military pathos and sentiment all soldiers and sailors will instantly understand.

Jason, Professor Emeritus, United States Naval Academy, and author of <i>Acts and Shadows: The Vietnam War in American Literary Culture</i></b><br><br>"<i>Honoring The Enemy</i> is one of the best Peter Wake novels to date.

Byron has recently gained fame for her explanatory notes on Charles Babbage's analytical engine, which constitute the first explanation of the concept of computer programming. In recognition of her efforts, the Department of Defense christened its most recent programming language ADA. A gifted mathematician in a time when women didn't do mathematics, Byron had a complex and contradictory nature. She died in 1852 at the age of 37, and her contribution to our understanding of computers went unappreciated for more than 100 years.

A codependent lifestyle is a miserable, fearful life. From never feeling secure, to the need to always be in control, the extremes of codependency fuel the chaos and pain in our lives. In Escape from Codependent Christianity, Dr. James B. Richards examines this common phenomenon in light of the truth of Scripture. Codependency is not complicated. It involves depending upon others for what we have no right to expect from them. Codependents often fall into the trap of living on other people&#39;s approval for their own sense of self-worth. They may depend on others for decisions or happiness. No matter what the needs are, the key to codependency involves trying to get from others what people cannot truly give.</p><p>As president and founder of Impact Ministries, James Richards reaches thousands around the world with the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. Richards is a worldwide conference speaker as well as the author of several books that have challenged believers to new levels of power and service. With doctorates in theology, human behavior, and alternative medicine, and an honorary doctorate in world evangelism, Dr. Richards has pioneered Bible-based approaches to meeting the needs of today&#39;s world.

He recalls the memorable season as the year of the pitcher, when Tiger Denny McClain won 31 games, teammate Mickey Lolich 22, and hitters struggled throughout the sport. He also notes that, at a time of racial unrest, the Tigers and their black stars--Willie Horton, Earl Wilson, and Gates Brown--promoted a sense of racial cohesiveness in the city. Profiles of numerous team members, including fun-loving slugger Norm Cash and future Hall-of-Famer Al Kaline, round out this solid choice for most baseball collections. <i>Wes Lukowsky</i></p><h2>Paint the Town Red</h2><p>Brian Meeks&#x2019;s novel begins with the release from jail of a young Rastafarian who was involved in the political violence that erupted when forces hostile to the radical socialist currents within the 1972 Manley administration sought to destabilize Jamaican society. As Mikey takes a minibus through Kingston, his story is told as a series of carefully crafted flashbacks. A series of encounters and the memories they provoke reveal that few have escaped unscathed from those years: there are the dead, the imprisoned, the maddened, the turncoats, and those like Mikey who carry the burden of those times. One of the encounters is, we learn in a postscript to the novel, with Rohan who, at the time of Mikey&#x2019;s imprisonment, is a youth in a family with which Mikey is involved, particularly Rohan&#x2019;s sister, who is killed in the shootout. Rohan has suffered this loss deeply, but has survived to move forward, while Mikey, with the stigma of his imprisonment, is trapped in the past. It is Rohan, we discover, who is telling Mikey&#x2019;s story, a revelation that casts a reflexive light not only on the relationship between the actual author and the events he fictionalizes, but the relationship between the novelist who, whatever his origins, writes from a position of relative security in comparison to the lives that form his subject.<br></p><p><b>Brian Meeks</b> is head of the department of government at UWI, Jamaica.

Her mother was a caricaturist who designed 165 of Finland&#39;s stamps and her father was a sculptor. She studied painting in Finland, Sweden and France, and subsequently became a book illustrator. Her extraordinary illustrative style is seen as a design classic the world over. Originally written in Swedish, the Moomintroll books have been translated into over 40 languages and adapted for television, film, radio and opera. Tove Jansson lived alone on a small island in the gulf of Finland, where most of her books were written. She died in 2001.<p><br>Chapter 1<br>In which Moomintroll, Snufkin, and Sniff find<br>the Hobgoblin&#x2019;s Hat; how five small clouds<br>unexpectedly appear, and how the Hemulen<br>finds himself a new hobby.<br>One spring morning at four o&#x2019;clock the first cuckoo arrived in the Valley of the Moomins. He perched on the blue roof of Moomin house and cuckooed eight times&#x2014;rather hoarsely to be sure, for it was still a bit early in the spring.<br>Then he flew away to the east.<br>Moomintroll woke up and lay a long time looking at the ceiling before he realized where he was. He had slept a hundred nights and a hundred days, and his dreams still thronged about his head trying to coax him back to sleep.<br>But as he was wriggling around trying to find a cozy new spot to sleep he caught sight of something that made him quite wide awake&#x2014;Snufkin&#x2019;s bed was empty!<br>Moomintroll sat up. Yes, Snufkin&#x2019;s hat had gone, too. &#x201c;Goodness gracious me!&#x201d; he said, tiptoeing to the open window. Ah-ha, Snufkin had been using the rope ladder. Moomintroll scrambled over the window-sill and climbed cautiously down on his short legs. He could see Snufkin&#x2019;s footprints plainly in the wet earth, wandering here and there and rather difficult to follow, until suddenly they did a long jump and crossed over themselves. &#x201c;He must have been very happy,&#x201d; decided Moomintroll. &#x201c;He did a somersault here&#x2014;that&#x2019;s clear enough.&#x201d;<br>Suddenly Moomintroll lifted his nose and listened. Far away Snufkin was playing his gayest song, &#x201c;All small beasts should have bows in their tails.&#x201d; And Moomintroll began to run toward the music.<br>Down by the river he came upon Snufkin who was sitting on the bridge with his legs dangling over the water, his old hat pulled down over his ears.<br>&#x201c;Hello,&#x201d; said Moomintroll sitting down beside him.<br>&#x201c;Hello to you,&#x201d; said Snufkin, and went on playing.<br>The sun was up now and shone straight into their eyes, making them blink. They sat swinging their legs over the running water feeling happy and carefree.<br>They had had many strange adventures on this river and had brought home many new friends. Moomintroll&#x2019;s mother and father always welcomed all their friends in the same quiet way, just adding another bed and putting another leaf in the dining-room table. And so Moomin house was rather full&#x2014;a place where everyone did what they liked and seldom worried about tomorrow. Very often unexpected and disturbing things used to happen, but nobody ever had time to be bored, and that is always a good thing.<br>When Snufkin came to the last verse of his spring song he put his mouth-organ in his pocket and said:<br>&#x201c;Is Sniff awake yet?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think so,&#x201d; answered Moomintroll. &#x201c;He always sleeps a week longer than the others.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Then we must certainly wake him up,&#x201d; said Snufkin as he jumped down. &#x201c;We must do something special today because it&#x2019;s going to be fine.&#x201d;<br>So Moomintroll made their secret signal under Sniff&#x2019;s window: three ordinary whistles first and then a long one through his paws, and it meant: &#x201c;There&#x2019;s something doing.&#x201d; They heard Sniff stop snoring, but nothing moved up above.<br>&#x201c;Once more,&#x201d; said Snufkin. And they signaled even louder than before.<br>Then the window banged up.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m asleep,&#x201d; shouted a cross voice.<br>&#x201c;Come on down and don&#x2019;t be angry,&#x201d; said Snufkin. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re going to do something very special.&#x201d;<br>Then Sniff smoothed out his sleep-crinkled ears and clambered down the rope ladder. (I should perhaps mention that they had rope ladders under all the windows because it took so long to use the stairs.)<br>It certainly promised to be a fine day. Everywhere befuddled little creatures just woken from their long winter sleep poked about rediscovering old haunts, and busied themselves airing clothes, brushing out their moustaches and getting their houses ready for the spring.<br>Many were building new homes and I am afraid some were quarrelling. (You can wake up in a very bad temper after such a long sleep.)<br>The Spirits that haunted the trees sat combing their long hair, and on the north side of the tree trunks, baby mice dug tunnels amongst the snow-flakes.<br>&#x201c;Happy Spring!&#x201d; said an elderly Earthworm. &#x201c;And how was the winter with you?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Very nice, thank you,&#x201d; said Moomintroll. &#x201c;Did you sleep well, sir?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Fine,&#x201d; said the Worm. &#x201c;Remember me to your father and mother.&#x201d;<br>So they walked on, talking to a lot of people in this way, but the higher up the hill they went the less people there were, and at last they only saw one or two mother mice sniffing around and spring-cleaning.<br>It was wet everywhere.<br>&#x201c;Ugh&#x2014;how nasty,&#x201d; said Moomintroll, picking his way gingerly through the melting snow. &#x201c;So much snow is never good for a Moomin. Mother said so.&#x201d; And he sneezed.<br>&#x201c;Listen, Moomintroll,&#x201d; said Snufkin. &#x201c;I have an idea. What about going to the top of the mountain and making a pile of stones to show that we were the first to get there?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes, let&#x2019;s,&#x201d; said Sniff, and set off at once so as to get there before the others.<br>When they reached the top the March wind gambolled around them, and the blue distance lay at their feet. To the west was the sea; to the east the river looped round the Lonely Mountains; to the north the great forest spread its green carpet, and to the south the smoke rose from Moomintroll&#x2019;s chimney, for Moominmamma was cooking the breakfast. But Sniff saw none of these things because on the top of the mountain lay a hat&#x2014;a tall, black hat.<br>&#x201c;Someone has been here before!&#x201d; he said.<br>Moomintroll picked up the hat and looked at it. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a rarey hat,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Perhaps it will fit you, Snufkin.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No, no,&#x201d; said Snufkin, who loved his old green hat. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s much too new.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Perhaps father would like it,&#x201d; mused Moomintroll.<br>&#x201c;Well, anyway we&#x2019;ll take it with us,&#x201d; said Sniff. &#x201c;But now I want to go home&#x2014;I&#x2019;m dying for some breakfast, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I should just say I am,&#x201d; said Snufkin.And that was how they found the Hobgoblin&#x2019;s Hat and took it home with them, without guessing for one moment that this would cast a spell on the Valley of the Moomins, and that before long they would all see strange things...<br>When Moomintroll, Snufkin and Sniff went out onto the verandah the others had already had their breakfast and gone off in various directions. Moominpappa was alone reading the newspaper.<br>&#x201c;Well, well! So you have woken up, too,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Remarkably little in the paper today. A stream burst its dam and swamped a lot of ants. All saved. The first cuckoo arrived in the valley at four o&#x2019;clock and then flew off to the east.&#x201d; (This is a good omen, but a cuckoo flying west is still better... )<br>&#x201c;Look what we&#x2019;ve found,&#x201d; interrupted Moomintroll, proudly. &#x201c;A beautiful new top hat for you!&#x201d;<br>Moominpappa put aside his paper and examined the hat very thoroughly. Then he put it on in front of the long mirror. It was rather too big for him&#x2014;in fact it nearly covered his eyes, and the effect was very curious.<br>&#x201c;Mother,&#x201d; screamed Moomintroll. &#x201c;Come and look at Father.&#x201d;Moominmamma opened the kitchen door and looked at him with amazement.<br>&#x201c;How do I look?&#x201d; asked Moominpappa.<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s all right,&#x201d; said Moominmamma. &#x201c;Yes, you look very handsome in it, but it&#x2019;s just a tiny bit too big.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Is it better like this?&#x201d; asked Moominpappa, pushing the hat on to the back of his head.<br>&#x201c;Hm,&#x201d; said Moominmamma. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s smart, too, but I almost think you look more dignified without a hat.&#x201d;<br>Moominpappa looked at himself in front, behind and from both sides, and then he put the hat on the table with a sigh.<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re right,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Some people look better without hats.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Of course, dear,&#x201d; said Moominmamma, kindly. &#x201c;Now eat up your eggs, children, you need feeding up after living on pine needles all the winter.&#x201d; And she disappeared into the kitchen again.<br>&#x201c;But what shall we do with the hat?&#x201d; asked Sniff. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s such a fine one.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Use it as a waste paper basket,&#x201d; said Moominpappa, and thereupon he took himself upstairs to go on writing his life story. (The heavy volume about his stormy youth.)<br>Snufkin put the hat down on the floor between the table and the kitchen door. &#x201c;Now you&#x2019;ve got a new piece of furniture again,&#x201d; he said, grinning, for Snufkin could never understand why people liked to have things. He was quite happy wearing the old suit he had had since he was born (nobody knows when and where that happened), and the only possession he didn&#x2019;t give away was his mouth-organ.<br>&#x201c;If you&#x2019;ve finished breakfast we&#x2019;ll go and see how the Snorks are getting on,&#x201d; said Moomintroll. But before going out into the garden he threw his eggshell into the wastepaper basket, for he was (sometimes) a well brought up Moomin.<br>The dining room was now empty.<br>In the corner between the table and the kitchen door stood the Hobgoblin&#x2019;s Hat with the eggshell in the bottom. And then something really strange happened. The eggshell began to change its shape.<br>(This is what happens, you see. If something lies long enough in the Hobgoblin&#x2019;s Hat it begins to change into something quite different&#x2014;what that will be you never know beforehand. It was lucky that the hat hadn&#x2019;t fitted Moominpappa because the-Protector-of-all-Small-Beasts knows what woul...</p></p><h2>Diary of a Drug Fiend</h2><p>This is a true story. . .

He made pilgrimages to true time capsules, like a remote lagoon in Western Australia, spent time in research collections photographing forms of microscopic life, and even found ways to create visual parallels between the growth of organs in the human body and the patterns seen on the surface of the earth.</p><p>The resulting volume is a glorious picture book of Planet Earth, depicting the amazing biodiversity that surrounds us all. Lanting&#x2019;s true gift lies beyond his technical mastery: it is his eye for geometry in the beautiful chaos of nature that allows him to show us the world as it has never been seen before. From crabs to jellyfish, diatoms to vast geological formations, jungles to flowers, monkeys to human embryos, LIFE is a testament to the magical beauty of life in all its forms and is one of Lanting&#x2019;s most remarkable achievements.</p></p><p>Christine Eckstrom is a writer, editor, and videographer.

The Brehon has an honour price,</i> l�g n-enech [literally the price of his or her face] <i>of sixteen</i> s�ts. <i>The Brehon has the power to judge all cases of law-breaking within the kingdom, to allocate fines and to keep the peace.</i>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>AS SOON AS DAWN broke on the morning of Michaelmas, the mist rose over the stony land of the kingdom of the Burren. It clung to the sinuous curves of the swirling limestone terraces on the mountains and filled the valleys with its thick, soft, insubstantial presence; it swathed the crenellated tops of the tower houses and wrapped the small oblong cottages in its feather-light folds; it encircled the walls of the great fortified dwelling places:<i>cathair, lios</i> or <i>rath,</i> and rested softly over the stone-paved fields.Mara, Brehon, or judge, in the kingdom of the Burren, a tall, slim, dark-haired woman, wearing the traditional <i>l�ine</i>, a creamy-white linen tunic, under her green gown, stood at the gate of the law school of Cahermacnaghten and for the fortieth time that morning peered hopefully through the heavy mist. She was expecting her six scholars back from their holiday and not a single boy had arrived yet.'You might as well stay warm inside, Brehon,' said Brigid, her housekeeper, coming out from the kitchen house inside the law school enclosure. 'The chances are that none of them will come today,' she continued, brushing the drops of mist from her pale sandy-red hair. 'The fog is bad enough here. It will be worse on the hills and the mountains. There's even some frost about: Cumhal said that the grass was white on the north field when he and Sean were doing the milking.''I suppose you're right, Brigid,' Mara replied. Normally she could see for miles across the flat tableland of the upper Burren but today she could barely make out objects only fifty yards ahead of her. The small sunken lanes that ran between the fields were blotted out and their red-berried hedges had become part of the grey landscape. There was no sound. Even the swallows, which only yesterday had been chattering busily on the rooftrees of barns and houses, had now fallen silent.'Why don't you come inside?' urged Brigid. 'They won't come today. Cumhal brought a load of turf in and there is a good fire in the schoolhouse if you want to work there. It's freezing weather.'Brigid and Cumhal had been the servants of Mara's fatherwhen he had been Brehon of the Burren and now served the daughter with the same respect, commitment and fidelity as they had shown to the father. Nevertheless, Mara usually found herself obeying Brigid as if she were still four years old, so she turned obediently to go indoors. Then she stopped. Her quick ears had heard a creaking sound. She started to walk down the road, and Brigid trotted rapidly after her.'It's just a cart,' said Brigid after a moment.'It's Ragnall MacNamara, the MacNamara steward,' said Mara.'Out collecting the Michaelmas tribute for the MacNamara, I suppose,' Brigid muttered sourly. 'There was a lot of talk about that last night at the Michaelmas Eve <i>c�il�.</i> The word was that the MacNamara is not content with the tribute that his clan usually give; he's telling them what he wants from them. Giving them orders, no less!''Really!' Mara said no more because Ragnall, mounted on his white horse, was now quite near, but she was astonished. The annual tribute to the <i>taoiseach,</i> hallowed and shaped by custom and tradition, was normally conducted with grace and courtesy on both sides. The clansmen gave what they could afford from their year's produce and the <i>taoiseach</i> thanked them and promised his favour and protection in return.She saluted Ragnall with the usual blessing. He muttered, 'and St Patrick,' without looking at her. Obviously he still resented the fine she had imposed upon him at the last judgement day for hitting Aengus, the miller, with a heavy stick.'I was wondering if you had seen any of my scholars,Ragnall,' Mara asked him calmly. 'I'm expecting them today, but none has arrived yet. Are the roads very bad over towards the east of the Burren?''Bad enough,' he grunted, without replying to her query.'But you've managed to get around,' she persisted. 'You came over the Clerics' Pass?' Her eye went to the heavily laden cart. She counted seven bags of wheat flour there, each with the milling date, 25 September, and over-stamped with the MacNamara insignia of a prancing lion. This meant that Ragnall had managed to get up the slopes of Oughtmama to take the annual tribute from Aengus. It would have been a pleasure to him, she thought, to watch the miller load the bags of unbleached linen with his precious flour. Wheat grew in only a few favoured spots here in the cool, moisture-laden, stony environment and wheat flour was highly valued.He grunted again, but still said nothing. He clapped his heels to the sides of his white saddle horse and jerked his head at Niall MacNamara, who was driving the cart, and continued on down the road without a backward glance.'Did you ever see such a man as that!' exclaimed Brigid, her green eyes flashing with anger at the discourtesy. 'You mark my words, Brehon, one of these days that man will get what's coming to him.'&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>By mid-afternoon the mist had begun to lift. Suddenly colour, shape and sounds came back to the landscape. The wet flagstones that paved the fields shone with a gleam of silver in the autumn sun, the magenta-coloured cranesbill glowed, beads of moisture dropped from the delicate, droopingheads of the pale blue harebells and the swallows gathered in large chattering flocks.Twelve-year-old Hugh, the son of a prosperous silversmith in the Burren, had arrived at the law school around midday, but there was still no sign of the other scholars. Now Hugh was getting restive and uneasy in the company of three adults without the other boys. Mara found him moodily kicking a stone on the road outside her house and cast around for something to make the day seem less long for him.'Shall we go to the market at Noughaval?' she asked. 'That might be fun. We'll take Bran as well. Bran,' she called, and a magnificent white wolfhound bounded out of the stables, tail wagging vigorously. 'Run in and get his lead, Hugh. We'll walk in case the mist comes down again at sunset.'Noughaval was a short walk to the south of Cahermacnaghten. It was a small settlement of a few houses, a church and a fine market cross at the edge of the square. The market square was crowded today. It seemed as if every trader in the three kingdoms of Burren, Corcomroe and Thomond had set up stall. Their wares were varied: the usual butter and cheese; fish fresh from the nearby Atlantic waters; leather stalls selling belts and satchels; wool stalls with lengths of rough fustian, honey cakes and hot pies for the hungry; and more-exotic stalls selling silks and laces brought in from foreign countries. In one corner of the square, near to the entrance gate, the O'Lochlainn steward, a big genial man, was collecting the annual Michaelmas tribute from the many O'Lochlainn tenants. He was mounted on a tall box so that none couldmiss him and beside him, outside the market wall, was a cart piled high with sheepskins and firkins of butter and rolled hides of fine calf skin or goat skin.'God bless the work, Liam,' called Mara and he grinned in answer as he stowed away some silver in his leather pouch before turning to greet her.'You are well, Brehon?' he enquired. 'The <i>taoiseach</i> is over there talking to the O'Brien. He'll be glad to see you. He was saying last night that he was going to consult you about some point of law.'Mara groaned inwardly. Ardal O'Lochlainn always did want to talk about some point of law. 'Here's some silver for you, Hugh,' she said. 'You go and enjoy yourself while I talk to the <i>taoiseach.</i> Bran, go with Hugh,' she added with a quick pat on Bran's narrow hairy head, and Hugh and Bran galloped off through the crowds towards the honey cake stall.'You are collecting the tribute here at the fair?' she asked Liam.Liam shrugged. 'It's the easiest way. Let them come to me.''I met Ragnall MacNamara out on the road this morning,' Mara told him. 'He must have been out since dawn, his cart was already piled.''Well, the MacNamaras don't have too many families here on the Burren,' Liam said dismissively. 'If I were to do that I would be on the road for weeks, going from farm to farm. Besides, the O'Lochlainn likes it best this way: he wouldn't want it to seem as if he were asking for anything; the tribute is for the clan to give.'Mara nodded. The O'Lochlainn clan had been kingsof the Burren in former days and the unconscious dignity of royalty had descended to the present chieftain, Ardal O'Lochlainn.'Anyway,' continued Liam with an amused look, 'it's just as well that Ragnall is not here today. It gives his daughter, Maeve, a bit of time for courting. There's going to be trouble about these two,' he whispered, pointing to a young couple in the churchyard. 'The O'Briens and the MacNamaras don't get on too well. Ragnall MacNamara will never agree to a marriage between his daughter and the son of Teige O'Brien.'Mara's eyes followed his pointing finger. She knew young Donal O'Brien by sight; he and Fachtnan, the eldest of her law school scholars, had become great friends in the last few weeks of the Trinity term. Donal was a hot-tempered boy, inclined to drink too much and to get into fights; probably basically a nice boy, she thought indulgently, just the spoiled only son of a wealthy <i>taoiseach.</i> Maeve MacNamara she didn't recognize. No doubt I have seen her before, thought Mara, but she was probably one of those girls who had suddenly blossomed into beauty with the dawning of adolescence and now was unfamiliar. She was quite small, but with a pretty, well-rounded figure and a face that, with its wide kitten-like eyes, delicate pink and white complexion and small pointed chin, reminded Mara of a heartsease pansy. Donal was bending over her, holding her two tiny fragile hands in his large ones and looking at her with adoration.'I suppose the O'Brien wouldn't think it was a good match for his only son,' she said sympathetically, but Liam shook his head.'No, it's not that at all,' he said emphatically. 'That boygets his own way about everything; his father would agree, but Ragnall won't consent. He would have to give too many cows to settle his daughter with the son of a <i>taoiseach.</i> The man is so mean that he would skin a mouse to get the fat off it.''Was it a good evening at the <i>c�il�,</i> yesterday, Liam?' asked Mara, changing the subject. After all, it was up to Ragnall to arrange a suitable marriage for his daughter. Liam, as she had planned, was immediately diverted.'The <i>craic</i> was mighty,' he said, smiling happily at the thought of the fun and the conversation and the sallies of wit, which would have been accompanied by large amounts of ale and mead.'No trouble?''Ah well,' he said, with a hasty glance in Ragnall's direction. 'There was a bit of a fight between Aengus and Ragnall, again. There's bad blood between those two. The MacNamara should sort it out before it gets any worse. They'll be killing each other if this goes on. And then, of course, that young fool Donal O'Brien had to put his oar in.''On Aengus's side?' asked Mara.'No, would you believe it. And after Ragnall turning him down when he wanted to marry the daughter! I suppose that Donal thought Ragnall might get to think better of him if he spoke up for him. Anyway, he took hold of Aengus, but Aengus flattened him. Donal was pretty far gone in drink, of course. Aengus cleared off after that and the O'Brien steward persuaded young Donal to go home, but I heard that the young fool would not be told and went flying after Aengus.''Oh well, as long as no harm was done,' said Mara tolerantly.'Brehon,' called Ardal O'Lochlainn, making his way through the crowd, which opened up respectfully to allow him to pass. 'You are looking well,' he added with his usual courtesy.'I'm very well thank you, Ardal,' Mara replied. 'Liam was saying that you might want to consult me on a point of law,' she added, with her usual directness.'It's just a matter of the MacNamara mill at Oughtmama,' he said. He sounded a little uncomfortable at having to approach the matter without the usual enquiries about health and comments on the weather. 'I just wanted to check with you. My understanding of the law is that no man can alter, without consultation, the flow of a river or stream that goes through a neighbour's land. Well, the stream that turns his millstone goes through my land on the mountain, and now Garrett MacNamara has ordered his tenant, Aengus MacNamara, the miller, to divert a few of the other streams on the top of mountain, above my land, so now my stream floods my land from time to time. Has he any right to do that?''He should certainly have consulted you and perhaps paid compensation if it has done any harm to your land,' Mara told him cautiously. 'The law is quite clear on that matter.' What a fuss about nothing, she thought. The stream only went through a hundred yards or so of O'Lochlainn land.Ardal O'Lochlainn's face brightened. 'So can I bring a case against him on the next judgement day?''I think it would be better to talk it over with Garrett first,' said Mara hastily, having spotted a disturbance over at the market cross. A fight would break out there soon, she thought, if someone did not intervene quickly.'And he has done the same thing on the other side, on Teige O'Brien's land,' Ardal continued, oblivious to the commotion behind him. He was a man of single mind. He reminded Mara of a dog she had once, which was so obsessed with digging holes that he would even ignore a rainstorm and stay digging rather than retreat to his cosy bed in the stables.'I'll consult my law texts and let you know,' she promised and hurriedly made her way to the market cross.The crowd had gathered around a trader selling linen. He was a small man with a thin face and a back that looked permanently bowed by the weight of his pack.'What's the trouble?' she asked crisply.The crowd immediately fell into a respectful silence and parted to allow her to go through. She took a quick glance around. A large roll of coarse unbleached linen was lying on top of an open pack on the ground and beside it a pair of iron shears. The trader picked them up hastily and stuffed them into his pack. Then he began to roll up the linen.'Diarmuid, what is happening here?' Mara quickly picked out a neighbour of hers, a man she could trust.'Well, Brehon,' said Diarmuid, his freckled face worried and his sandy brows drawn together with a frown. 'It seems as if a lot of people have got short measure from this man, Guaire O'Brien from the kingdom of Corcomroe.'Corcomroe was only a mile or so from Noughaval, but the people of the Burren were intensely clannish. The O'Brien clan of the Burren were liked and respected by their neighbours, as were O'Lochlainn, O'Connor or even MacNamara, but it was a different matter with an O'Brien from Corcomroe.

Foreigners had been denied access to Japan for centuries, yet Adams had been living in this unknown land for years. He had risen to the highest levels in the ruling shogun's court, taken a Japanese name, and was now offering his services as adviser and interpreter.<br><br>Seven adventurers were sent to Japan with orders to find and befriend Adams, in the belief that he held the key to exploiting the opulent riches of this forbidden land. Their arrival was to prove a momentous event in the history of Japan and the shogun suddenly found himself facing a stark choice: to expel the foreigners and continue with his policy of isolation, or to open his country to the world. For more than a decade the English, helped by Adams, were to attempt trade with the shogun, but confounded by a culture so different from their own, and hounded by scheming Jesuit monks and fearsome Dutch assassins, they found themselves in a desperate battle for their lives. <br><br><i>Samurai William</i> is the fascinating story of a clash of two cultures, and of the enormous impact one Westerner had on the opening of the East.<br></p><p><b>Giles Milton </b>is the author of <i>Nathaniel's Nutmeg</i> (FSG, 1999), <i>Big Chief Elizabeth </i>(FSG, 2000) and <i>The Riddle and the Knight</i> (FSG, 2001). He lives in London.<br><b>Prologue</b> <p><b><i>They had reached</i></b> the end of the world. A tremendous storm had pushed them deep into the unknown, where the maps and globes showed only monsters of the deep. The night sky sparkled, but the unfamiliar stars had proved a mischievous guide to these lost and lonely adventurers.&nbsp; </p><p>For almost two years, William Adams and his crew had braved wild and tempestuous oceans. They had clashed with spear-toting island chieftains, and suffered from sickness and empty bellies. Now, on April 12, 1600, these few survivors had once again sighted land, where they expected death at the hands of barbarous savages.&nbsp; </p><p>The bell of the great Manju-ji monastery clanged at dawn. As the weak spring sunlight spilled over the southern mountains, a dozen temples seemed to echo in reply. It was already light on the watery delta of the Oita River, but night still lingered in the palaces and pagodas of Funai. Their cuneiform roofs trapped the shadows. It would be several hours before daylight pierced the gridlike maze of walkways.&nbsp; </p><p>The strange vessel that was drifting helplessly into the harbor was in a terrible state of repair. Her sails were in shreds and her timbers had been bleached by the sun. With her stately poop and mullioned prow, she was quite unlike the junks that occasionally dropped anchor on the southern shores of Japan. No sooner had she been sighted than the alarm was raised and a small party of townsmen rowed out to view the vessel. Those who clambered aboard were greeted by a pitiful sight. A dozen adventurers lay helpless and groaning in their own filth. Many were covered in blotches -- a sign of advanced scurvy -- while others had been stricken with terrible tropical diseases. Their victuals had run out long ago and they had subsisted on the rats and other vermin that scavenged for scraps in the filthy swill in the hold of the vessel. Only William Adams was sufficiently coherent to greet the boarding party. He blinked in astonishment as he caught his first glimpse of a civilization that was older -- and perhaps more sophisticated -- than his own.&nbsp; </p><p>Adams immediately realized that these men had come not to their rescue, but to pillage the ship. He could only hope that he and his men would receive a welcome on shore. They had achieved the remarkable feat of crossing both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, negotiating the treacherous Magellan Straits en route. They had survived Antarctic blizzards and tropical storms, and had watched in horror as their friends and fellow crewmates had weakened and expired. Of a fleet of five ships, only one had made it to Japan. Of an estimated one hundred crew members, just twenty-four men were still alive. Of these, six were on the verge of death.&nbsp; </p><p>After more than nineteen months at sea, Adams had reached the fabled island of Japan, where no Englishman had ever before set foot. As he stepped ashore, he prayed that his voyage of discovery had at long last come to an end. In fact, it was just about to begin.&nbsp; </p><p>The adventurers of Elizabethan London knew almost nothing about Japan. When they unrolled their maps and gazed at the remote East, they saw only squiggles, dots, and grotesque sea monsters. Gerardus Mercator's 1569 map of the world depicted this kingdom as a lozenge-shaped blob with two tentacles of islands. Edward Wright's projection was little better. When he came to draw Japan, he delved deep into his imagination and came up with an island that looked like a misshapen prawn with a long fluffy beard. Although he took great pride in labeling his map "a true hydrographical description," he admitted that he had only accurately drawn "so much of the world as hath been hitherto discovered." That -- alas -- did not include Japan.&nbsp; </p><p>The Bookish gentlemen elsewhere in northern Europe were equally ignorant as to the whereabouts, and people, of Japan. In the Low Countries, France, and the Holy Roman Empire the only information about this mysterious "kingdom" was to be found in the account of the great Venetian traveler Marco Polo. That was already three centuries old and was based on nothing more than hearsay. Polo himself had never been to Japan -- a land he called Chipangu -- but he had learned from the Chinese that the "people are white, civilised and well-favoured" and he noted that they were ferociously proud and "dependent on nobody." He added that no one -- not even their neighbors the Chinese -- dared to sail to Japan, for the distances were enormous and the dangers were great.&nbsp; </p><p>Forbidden kingdoms made for rich kingdoms in the minds of gentlemen adventurers, and distant Japan -- the Land of the Rising Sun -- was believed to glisten with gilded splendor. "The quantity of gold they have here is endless," wrote an excited Polo, "for they find it in their own islands." The emperor's palace was "entirely roofed with fine gold:' while the windows glittered and twinkled, "so that altogether the richness of the palace is past all bounds and all belief."&nbsp; </p><p>Dozens of English adventurers were lured into uncharted seas by such tantalizing riches, placing their trust in the good Lord and a fair breeze. They studied their maps, consulted their charts, and concluded -- quite logically -- that the frosty Arctic Ocean offered the shortest route to the East. They little imagined that their fragile galleons would be battered by monstrous icebergs and translucent cliffs of ice. Sir Hugh Willoughby's 1553 expedition to the East had been the most spectacular failure. His vessel had been. trapped in the icy jaws of the White Sea, to the north of Muscovy, and his men had frozen to death in an Arctic blizzard.&nbsp; </p><p>Copyright � 2002 Giles Milton</p></p><h2>Voices of the Old South: Eyewitness Accounts, 1528-1861</h2><p><p>Spanning the period from the earliest European expeditions to the eve of the Civil War, <i>Voices of the Old South</i> assembles a fascinating array of firsthand perspectives on the great events that shaped the region as well as its customs, attitudes, and commonplace occurrences. Encompassing key themes in southern history, the eyewitness accounts Alan Gallay has brought together for this volume are remarkable in their variety. In addition, Gallay's selections reflect a multicultural approach in which African Americans, native Americans, and women are treated not as mere tokens but as major participants in southern life.</p><p>Unlike many works on the Old South, which tend to focus on the immediate pre-war years, this volume gives equal attention to the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries. Its geographic definition of the region is notably broad, including not only British America but also French Louisiana, the mountain areas as well as the lowlands, the pine barrens and the cotton belt. While famous names&#x2015;such as Thomas Jefferson, Frederick Douglass, Harriet Jacobs, and Frances Anne Kemble&#x2015;can be found here, Gallay also features writings by a number of obscure or less familiar figures. A French carpenter's account of an ill-fated expedition in Florida, a Scottish tradesman's description of the social mores of Georgia and the Carolinas, a free black's journal of daily life in Natchez, Mississippi&#x2015;these are but a few of the rare and unusual documents excerpted in the book.</p><p>In his introduction, Gallay explains the diversity of his selections, contending that to identify common threads among particular groups is not enough: we must also understand how the common threads take different forms when they penetrate different subcultures. By allowing the reader to listen to the richly divergent voices of those who lived in or visited the Old South, this collection suggests some fruitful ways of reaching that understanding.</p></p><p>Spanning the period from the earliest European expeditions to the eve of the Civil War, Voices of the Old South assembles a fascinating array of firsthand perspectives on the great events that shaped the region as well as its customs, attitudes, and commonplace occurrences.

Do you downplay your abilities for fear of outshining Black men? Do you speak one way in the office, another way to your girlfriends? Is it sometimes a struggle to feel good about how you look -- your skin color, your hair, your body size and shape?</p><p>In this arresting and groundbreaking work, authors Charisse Jones and Kumea Shorter-Gooden, Ph.D., articulate with deep understanding what it is really like to be Black and female in America today.</p><p>Based on the African American Women's Voices Project, an interview and questionnaire study with four hundred women across the United States and from many walks of life, <em>Shifting</em> reveals that a large number of Black women feel pressure to compromise their true selves in order to fit in to American society. From one moment to the next, they report changing inwardly and outwardly -- <em>Shifting</em> "White," then <em>Shifting</em> "Black" again, <em>Shifting</em> "corporate," <em>Shifting</em> "cool" -- a coping and survival skill that often diminishes the joys of living an authentic life.</p><p><em>Shifting</em> can have a devastating effect on a woman's body and soul. In a culture that is both racist and sexist, Black women are suffering. They are susceptible to an array of psychological problems, including anxiety, low self-esteem, disordered eating, depression, and even outright self-hatred. They may make others feel comfortable, but too often they are left feeling conflicted, weary, and alone.</p><p>Yet their revealing voices are utterly cathartic. As Black women talk openly about their lives -- contending with the workplace, mothering, coming to terms with their beauty, forging relationships with men, living their spirituality -- they describe what it takes to "make it" despite everything, and bring to light how essential it is to explode the myths and stereotypes still in place.</p><p>With this deeper perspective, Black women will find the path back to their true selves and come to understand how important it is to be aware of <em>Shifting</em> in their own lives. And readers of all genders and ethnicities will gain a heightened sensitivity to the continued damage wrought by bias and prejudice, and an increased awareness of what we can all do to make a difference.</p></p><p><p>Charisse Jones is a national correspondent for <em>USA Today</em>. A former staff writer for the <em>New York Times</em> and the <em>Los Angeles Times</em>, she has been a commentator for National Public Radio and is a contributing writer for <em>Essence</em> magazine.</p>USA Today correspondent Jones and psychologist Shorter-Gooden initiated the African American Women's Voices Project and recorded the experiences of 333 survey respondents and 71 interviewees. The results are here compiled to form an urgent narrative, doggedly chasing the hypothesis of the book's title: that the twin bigotries of race and gender force black women to constantly "shift" between identities in order to accommodate the expectations thrust upon them by black men and white America. "From one moment to the next, they change their outward behavior, attitude, or tone, shifting `white,' then shifting `Black' again, shifting `corporate,' shifting `cool.' " The authors argue that the contemporary survival tactic of shifting is rooted in slavery, but history does not figure strongly, with the bulk of the book composed of quoted testimonies from the research subjects, tracking their shifting experiences in the realms of communication, mental health, beauty standards, romance, child-rearing and religion. Compelling and educational tribulations are piled on, but the authors rarely pause to reflect on the contradictions or solutions the stories present. Yet the book makes a real contribution, as men and women of all races will find it an illuminating if sometimes shocking record of life between two "isms."<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Colorful Quilts</h2><p>If you love color, you&#39;ll love the quilts in this book!

A cold, wet wind swept mist in from the dark and restless sea as he made his way along the coast road that defined the small coastal town of Pennywhistle.The multicolored lights at Pennywhistle Park, a tiny amusement center, were shrouded in ghostly haloes. The lights of the park&#x2019;s rides looked, the boy thought, the way a Christmas tree looked when you squinted your eyes, peeking at it one last time before sleepily climbing the stairs on Christmas Eve.Strolling the empty streets, young Nicholas McIver vaguely recognized the town. His mother had a sister who lived in a village that very much resembled this one, but he&#x2019;d visited only once, years earlier, and he was a bit foggy on the details.He did recall that Pennywhistle Park was located on a rocky point sticking out into the sea. It was nearly deserted at this hour, he saw, passing under the lighted entrance. The sun was long down, and the night was growing cold. Most children were home having supper or climbing into their warm beds. Why wasn&#x2019;t he?He couldn&#x2019;t say, really, but here he was.The Ferris wheel, his original destination, came to a creaky stop, and a few strangely silent children climbed out of the cars and rushed into their parents&#x2019; arms, all of them soon disappearing into the mist. Now, it seemed as if he had the entire park to himself. He stepped up to the ticket window. The ticket-taker, with his green eyeshade, looked an awful lot like Nick&#x2019;s best friend in the world, a man named Gunner. A dead-ringer, as his dad would say, down to his full white beard and gold-rimmed glasses!&#x201c;Sorry, son, park&#x2019;s shutting down for the night,&#x201d; the bearded man said when the lad approached, his money tightly clenched in his fist.&#x201c;Are all the rides closed, sir?&#x201d; Nick asked, marveling at the man&#x2019;s voice. He even sounded like Gunner!&#x201c;Well, there is one ride still open, lad. The Whirl-O-Drome.&#x201d;&#x201c;The spinning airplanes, do you mean? That&#x2019;s the one I&#x2019;ve come for, sir.&#x201d;&#x201c;Not just any old airplanes, son, but miniature Spitfires. Supermarines, just like the real thing our boys will be flying when the shooting war with Germany begins. Only without the working engines and machine guns, of course.&#x201d; The man laughed.&#x201c;Which way is the Whirl-O-Drome, sir?&#x201d;&#x201c;Farthest ride out there. Follow the midway here all the way to the end of the point. See that big flashing red propeller sign spinning round out there? Bit foggy to make out, but there she is, all right. Still catch a ride, looks like, if you hurry.&#x201d;&#x201c;Thank you very much, sir. If I can&#x2019;t ride the Ferris wheel, that looks like a good one.&#x201d;&#x201c;Fancy yourself a pilot, do you?&#x201d;&#x201c;Someday I will be one, sir. My father, you see, was a hero in the Great War. Shot down over the Ardennes, but he took more than a few German Fokkers with him. I plan to sign up with the Royal Flying Corps soon as I&#x2019;m old enough. You can count on that!&#x201d;&#x201c;Good lad. England will need thousands of brave boys like you before this coming war is over. I just heard over the wireless that German armies have marched into Belgium and Holland. And that Chamberlain has resigned, and Churchill is to be Prime Minister.&#x201d;&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve had the pleasure of meeting the great man, sir. And if anyone can bring us safely through this war, it is Winston Churchill.&#x201d;Nick McIver bade the man farewell and followed the darkened midway out to the Whirl-O-Drome. It was very windy and chilly. But he was wearing his father&#x2019;s old leather flying jacket and leather helmet, and both gave him a good deal of warmth.The ride was like a big wheel set on its side, with a slowly revolving beacon light at its hub and eight tiny silver Spitfire airplanes at the end of each spoke. He noticed that all the little planes were empty. As the great wheel turned, the propellers at the nose of each plane spun rapidly in the stiff breeze off the sea.There was a kindly old man in the ticket booth, snow-white hair and big blue eyes, like a baby. He, too, reminded the boy of someone. His grandfather. Yes, he looked exactly like Nick&#x2019;s grandfather! He smiled at Nick. This was indeed the strangest place&#x2014;everyone here reminded him of someone else!&#x201c;Sir, may I have just one ride? I&#x2019;m sure you&#x2019;re closing down for the night, and I don&#x2019;t want to be a bother.&#x201d;&#x201c;This ride never closes, Nick. I keep it open all the time. Just for young boys like you.&#x201d;&#x201c;But, but, sir, you called me &#x2018;Nick.&#x2019; How on earth do you know my name?&#x201d;&#x201c;Oh, I&#x2019;ve seen you about, here and there. My name&#x2019;s Captain Orion, but you just call me Cap&#x2019;n. Want to be a pilot someday, don&#x2019;t you, Nick? I&#x2019;ve seen that look in a boy&#x2019;s eyes before, y&#x2019;know.&#x201d;&#x201c;I&#x2019;d do anything to become one, sir. My father, whose name is Angus, flew a Sopwith Camel with C Flight, Number 40 Squadron, the very same squadron as Mick Mannock, the famous ace who shot down sixty-one German planes.&#x201d;&#x201c;Your dad was an ace, too, before he got shot down by Baron Manfred von Richtofen over the Ardennes forest. Lost the use of one of his legs, I believe. Walks with a cane.&#x201d;&#x201c;That&#x2019;s correct, sir. The Red Baron ended my father&#x2019;s service to his country. But how on earth did you know about all this?&#x201d;&#x201c;Why, Angus McIver is famous, too, Nick. A real hero.&#x201d;&#x201c;Thank you, sir. He&#x2019;d be pleased. Here&#x2019;s my money. I&#x2019;ll take five rides, please.&#x201d;&#x201c;Your money&#x2019;s no good on this ride. Future knights of the air like yerself ride the Whirl-O-Drome for free. Our patriotic duty, y&#x2019;see. Step inside the gate here, and I&#x2019;ll have you airborne before you know it.&#x201d;Cap&#x2019;n Orion brought the spinning ride gradually to a stop, let Nick pick the Spitfire he wanted to fly (they were all identical save the big red numbers painted on the stubby wings) and then helped him climb up inside the bare metal cockpit. He&#x2019;d chosen No. 7, his lucky number. The seat was like a small bucket with leather padding. It had a realistic-looking instrument panel, but when he reached out to touch it, he saw that the dials were all peeling and painted on wood.&#x201c;Does the joystick really work?&#x201d; Nick asked, pulling back on it.&#x201c;Sure does. Pull back to bring her nose up; push forward and she&#x2019;ll go into a dive.&#x201d;&#x201c;What about these two pedals?&#x201d; he asked, pushing them with his feet.&#x201c;Your rudder. She&#x2019;ll change course a couple of feet left or right, depending on which pedal you push, Nick. You ready for takeoff, Captain?&#x201d;&#x201c;I am, sir.&#x201d;&#x201c;Let me go crank her up, then.&#x201d;Cap&#x2019;n Orion disappeared back inside the ticket booth, and sure enough, the great wheel began to revolve, round and round. The sea mist made it seem like flying through clouds, and Nick quickly made use of the stick, climbing and diving, using the foot pedals to turn side-to-side.Orion stepped outside to watch the boy.&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t this thing go any faster?&#x201d; Nick cried out through cupped hands as he whirled by.The man gave him a thumbs-up and ran back inside the booth. Nick could see him through the window, turning a large wheel mounted on the wall.Suddenly, the little Spitfire was going so fast Nick could hardly believe it. He was amazed the toy airplane didn&#x2019;t just fly right off the end of the long pole. Everything was a blur. He had to pull the old leather goggles down over his eyes because his eyes were tearing up so badly.He looked around. He could no longer see the dark town or Pennywhistle Park or even Cap&#x2019;n Orion inside the ticket booth. It was a little frightening, but Nick supposed he&#x2019;d better get used to real speed if he was ever going to fly a real Spitfire.Then the strangest thing of all happened. The painted-on instruments on the wooden panel began to light up one by one. He leaned forward and looked at them, tapping his finger on the rev counter. The needles were spinning behind real glass! And his altimeter was working! His altitude was six feet. His speed, however, was almost sixty miles per hour and climbing! And now there were tiny red lights flashing out on his wingtips.He heard a strange squawking noise behind the instrument panel and reached up under it to see what it was. There was a hook under there, and on it hung an old pair of headphones, just like the real ones his dad had brought home from the war. There were small ear-holes in his leather flying helmet, and he put the headphones on over it.&#x201c;Captain McIver! Captain McIver! This is Pennywhistle Control. Do you read me? Over.&#x201d;It sounded like Captain Orion, who sounded a lot like his grandfather.&#x201c;What&#x2019;s going on?&#x201d; Nick cried, &#x201c;Is everything all right? Is the ride broken? I think it&#x2019;s going too fast!&#x201d;&#x201c;Roger, Captain, I read you loud and clear. Everything under control. You are cleared for takeoff, skipper.&#x201d;&#x201c;Takeoff?&#x201d;&#x201c;See that flashing red button on top of the joystick?&#x201d;&#x201c;Yes, sir, I do,&#x201d; he said, and suddenly there really was a flashing red button.&#x201c;Just push that button, skipper, and you&#x2019;ll be on your merry way. Happy flying, sir!&#x201d;Push the button? On your way? Happy flying? Being a naturally curious boy, Nick McIver had no choice but to push the red button. What happened next took his breath away.Excerpted from <em>The Time Pirate</em>by Ted Bell.<br>Copyright � 2010 by Ted Bell.<br>Published in April 2010 by St. Martin&#x2019;s Press.<br>All rights reserved.

Since that time a tremendous resurgence of interest in the Indian way of life has occurred, resurgence due in part, at least, to the Laubins' life-long efforts at preservation and interpretation of Indian culture.</p> <p>As <em>The Indian Tipi </em>makes obvious, the American Indian is both a practical person and a natural artist. Indian inventions are commonly both serviceable <em>and </em>beautiful. Other tents are hard to pitch, hot in summer, cold in winter, poorly lighted, unventilated, easily blown down, and ugly to boot. The conical tipi of the Plains Indian has none of these faults. It can be pitched by one person. It is roomy, well ventilated at all times, cool in summer, well lighted, proof against high winds and heavy downpours, and, with its cheerful fire inside, snug in the severest winter weather. Moreover, its tilted cone, trim smoke flaps, and crown of poles, presenting a different silhouette from every angle, form a shapely, stately dwelling even without decoration.</p> <p>In this new edition the Laubins have retained all the invaluable aspects of the first edition, and have added a tremendous amount of new material on day-to-day living in the tipi: the section on Indian cooking has been expanded to include a large number and range of Indian foods and recipes, as well as methods of cooking over an open fire, with a reflector oven, and with a ground oven; there are new sections on making buckskin, making moccasins, and making cradle boards; there is a whole new section on child care and general household hints. Shoshoni, Cree, and Assiniboine designs have been added to the long list of tribal tipi types discussed.</p> <p>This new edition is richly illustrated with color and black and white photographs, and drawings to aid in constructing and living in the tipi. It is written primarily for the interested amateur, and will appeal to anyone who likes camping, the out-of-doors, and American Indian lore.</p></p><p><p><strong>Reginald and Gladys Laubin</strong>, his late wife, have devoted their personal and professional lives to the preservation and interpretation of American Indian dance and culture. They are recognized authorities on and performers of Indian dances and ceremonies. In 1972 for their contribution to dance they were presented the Capezio Dance Award, the first ethnic dancers to be honored with this highest award of the dance world. They were presented the Catlin Peace Pipe Award by Red Dawn, Sioux. They are the authors of <em>The Indian Tipi: Its history, Construction, and Use and American Indian Archery</em>, both published by the University of Oklahoma Press.</p></p><h2>Honey Bees (Insects)</h2><p>Introduces some of the characteristics of honey bees that includes information on their color, their wings, their five eyes, and how they collect pollen and nectar from flowers.</p><p>Martha Rustad is a Capstone Press author.</p><h2>Raising Your Children with Hypnosis</h2><p>Don Mottin ... covers his subject thoroughly, knowledgeably, and with feeling and sensitivity.

Based on the letters and diaries of the men who served and the women who followed them, this book is rich in the history of a fascinating era. Among the highlights are Wolfe's victory and death at Quebec, Wellington's Peninsular War, Waterloo, the retreat from Kabul, the Crimean War, and the Indian Mutiny. The focus of <em>Redcoat</em>, however, is on the individual recollections and experiences of the ordinary soldiers in the wars of Georgian and early Victorian England. Through their stories and anecdotes&#x2015;of uniforms, equipment, floggings, wounds, food, barrack life, courage, comradeship, death, love, and loss&#x2015;Richard Holmes provides a comprehensive portrait of an extraordinarily successful fighting force. 32 pages of plates, map, portraits, some in color</p><p>Richard Holmes is a celebrated military historian. He lives in England.The British army in the nineteenth century was not particularly large compared with such Continental armies as those of France and Russia. The enlisted men were often recruited from the "scum of the earth." Many officers gained their commissions and promotions through family connections rather than valor on the battlefield. Both officers and "rankers" often drank to excess. Yet, the British army was often a devastatingly effective fighting force that was instrumental in the expansion and maintenance of the Victorian empire. Holmes, a military historian, has written a masterful survey of this proud institution from the American Revolution to the Indian Sepoy Mutiny of 1857. What emerges is a picture of a force whose discipline and esprit de corps overcame the individual shortcomings of both officers and enlisted men. This is not a chronicle of continuous triumph, as Holmes' description of the horrific retreat from Kabul illustrates. Still, there is an abundance of genuine heroism here, and this absorbing work also effectively conveys the sights, sounds, and smells of barracks life. <i>Jay Freeman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Tunis Freyling almost kills a co-worker in a rage, and feels cursed by his dead father's murderous melancholy. Deciding to settle elsewhere in Siouxland, he meets the headstrong Clara Shortridge, who worries that her father's incestuous behavior drove him from England. They marry and settle down to farm and raise eight children, who prosper while their parents become increasingly estranged. Tension builds between Tunis and Clara because she's denied him conjugal rights since the birth of their last baby, but they remain together. Their brood matures to take off in different directions--the eldest son a farmer, the youngest a lawyer, a prim middle daughter a missionary to the Sioux--but the dark ancestral past finally catches up to the couple as Tunis disappears to kill himself on turning 70, and Clara drops dead years later on learning that two of her own have run off to live as man and wife. Incest and sexual relations are central to the saga as it unfolds, but in addition Manfred provides touches of wit and an abundance of vivid, memorable scenes from rural America in more bucolic times. Hamlin Garland run through a Freudian gauntlet--in an obsessive but richly detailed family history. A feast for fans, perhaps, but repetitive and relatively plotless for the rest. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Manfred's latest chronicle of the prairie territory called Siouxland (after No Fun on Sunday ) is an earthy, epic novel focusing on an Iowa farm family from 1884 to 1966. The initial chapters are slow going, not for lack of incident, but because the reader is bombarded with too much detail. The story does not develop narrative momentum until the marriage of Tunis Freyling and Clara Shortridge, each of whom keeps a secret from the other: in his case, a violent temper; in hers, a family history of incest. Their secrets turn out to be their legacy. Manfred's strength is his dialogue. His ear for natural and archaic speech is employed to good effect since the Freylings are a family of raconteurs, relentlessly digging up their pasts in a hermetic milieu. Outside events rarely intrude; two world wars and the Great Depression hardly affect them. The lengthy narrative could have benefited with some pruning. The dialogue is often verbose and the style clunky ("She smiled funny at him"). But readers who persevere eventually will find themselves caught up in the individual and collective struggles of the Freyling clan. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Medieval Cuisine of the Islamic World: A Concise History with 174 Recipes (California Studies in Food and Culture)</h2><p>Vinegar and sugar, dried fruit, rose water, spices from India and China, sweet wine made from raisins and dates&#x2014;these are the flavors of the golden age of Arab cuisine.

For declarations of love, gestures of thanks or congratulations, or as offerings of condolences, flowers are often the most eloquent and direct means of communication. The fascinating history of th symbolism of flowers is presented and explained here in all its facets with entertaining texts and stunning illustrations.</p><p>The author outlines the mythology of flowers in the ancient and early Christian worlds and explains their special significance for love and marriage, in customs and festivals, and the use of flowers as status symbols, as symbols of the seasons, or as metaphors for human qualities. This engaging descriptive text is followed by 36 of the most beautiful flower depictions of the Renaissance and Baroque. Individual sections cover in detail each flower, setting forth in short, vivid, texts its history, significance, and use."Say it with Flowers," is a florist's clich&#x201a;, but few realize how much flowers can convey. Marina Heilmeyer's The Language of Flowers: Symbols and Myths provides an engaging translation of their significance across centuries and cultures. Writing with journalist Susan Weiss, Heilmeyer, a botanist and art historian, explains the meanings and rituals surrounding 35 different flowers. Readers will learn that for Christians, ever since the Middle Ages, the daffodil has symbolized Christ's resurrection. Violets have an even longer-standing connection to the hereafter, dating back to the myth of Persephone, who was strolling through a meadow of violets when Hades kidnapped her. Rosemary, a symbol of love, was in ancient times burned at altars to appease or thank volatile gods.

New research implicating General James Wilkinson&#x2014;commanding general of the U.S. Army and coconspirator of Aaron Burr&#x2014;as the assassin is thoroughly discussed, while riveting testimony from&nbsp;13 leading experts in wound ballistics, forensic anthropology, suicide psychology, grave-site exhumation, and handwriting analysis offers new insight into what Lewis&#x2019;s exhumed remains might reveal. The new evidence not only destroys the foundation of suicide arguments by proving the primary evidence is a forgery, it also proves the Indian Agent escorting Lewis lied about his activities on the day of Lewis's death. The book also contains evidence of a previously unknown plot by Aaron Burr to seize New Orleans and invade Mexico in 1809, a repeat of his 1806 plot. It explains why Lewis suddenly changed his plans to travel to Washington, DC, by boat, and instead chose to go overland on the Natchez Trace, where he met his untimely death on October 11, 1809, at age 35.</p></p><p><p><b>James E.

Starrs noted a previous federal rejection of disinterment in his A Voice for the Dead (2005), an account of his investigations into historical homicides, including that of Jesse James.

Watching Wildlife offers a broad overview that will appeal especially to the armchair naturalist just venturing out. It covers such basics as descriptions of habitat regions and types of animals to find there; when to observe animals (specifying their cycles, both daily and seasonal); and tips for observing animals, arranged by broad group (e.g., birds of prey, waterfowl, bats, and more). More specific advice is offered on what to look for and listen to, how to equip yourself, and categories of public and private land to investigate (e.g., national parks, state parks, sanctuaries, even some private lands). An important chapter deals with the safety and ethics of observing wildlife. Appendixes list state, federal, and Canadian agencies as well as wildlife conservation organizations. For the reader who wants actually to track and observe mammals in the wild, The Complete Tracker provides detailed information on: habitat and range, foods, mating habits, seasonal habits, tracks, scat, signs, and vocalizations. A brief section provides basic advice on how to equip yourself, track, stalk, read sign, and, once found, observe the animals.

Making their way across two continents, they left in their wakes rich husbands, fame, adoration, and scandal. Lizzie, Irene, Nancy, Phyllis, and Nora were born in Virginia to a family impoverished by the Civil War. Their father remade his fortune by collaborating with the Yankees and building rail-roads; the sisters became southern belles and northern debutantes. James Fox draws on unpublished correspondence between the sisters and their husbands, lovers, children, and the powerful and glamorous of their day to construct a plural topography with the scope of a grand novel and the pace of a historical thriller. At its center is the most famous sister, Nancy, who married Waldorf Astor, one of the richest men in the world. Heroic, hilarious, magnetically charming, and a bully, Lady Astor became Britain&#39;s first female MP, championing women&#39;s rights and the poor. The beautiful Irene married Charles Dana Gibson and was the model for the Gibson Girl. The author&#39;s grandmother, Phyllis, married a famous economist, one of the architects of modern Europe. Fox has written an absorbing and spirited, intimate and sweeping account of extraordinary women at the highest reaches of society, their adventures set against the background of a tumultuous century.</p><p>With the same narrative panache and gift for good gossip that made <i>White Mischief</i> such fun, James Fox turns his attention here to the Langhorne sisters, Southern beauties who wielded a powerful influence in politics and culture during the tumultuous years from the turn of the 20th century through the Second World War. Lizzie (1867-1914) married a Virginian and stayed home, but her siblings conquered Yankee America and England. Irene (1873-1956) married Charles Dana Gibson and served as the model for that all-American icon, the Gibson girl. Baby sister Nora (1889-1955), dreamy and artistic, had a turbulent life scattered with lovers including, perhaps, F. Scott Fitzgerald. Nancy (1879-1964) entered English society through second husband Waldorf Astor and focused her formidable energies on politics as the first female member of Parliament and hostess to the notorious "Cliveden set." Sensitive, introspective Phyllis (1880-1937), the author's grandmother, survived a bad first marriage and an affair with a British officer to happily wed the brilliant English economist Bob Brand. Fox makes excellent use of thousands of the sisters' letters to reveal five dynamic personalities in their own words. His shrewd commentary provides context for a riveting tale of family ties, social commitments, and the complex interplay between them that shaped the Langhorne women's lives. <i>--Wendy Smith</i><b>James Fox</b> was born in Washington, D.C., in 1945.

In response to this terror, which is the fundamental mood of our time, Gruber advocates re-imagining our destiny as a path of initiation. <br><br>Describing an inner awakening to the spiritual world, whose earthly manifestation of its inherent divinity invites and necessitates our conscious participation, Gruber offers readings and practices that promote the incarnation of &#x201c;noble souls.&#x201d; Referring to the work of Nietzsche, Heidegger, and Steiner, <i><b>An Unknown Destiny</b></i> describes how psychotherapy can move beyond healing the ego to transcending the ego. Gruber shows how opening the soul to meditative or intuitive forms of thinking can contribute to the development of new soul faculties of perception and to the experience of moral freedom. Most important, he shows how the incomplete and continuously evolving Mystery of Golgotha can inspire the emergence and presence of modern human beings infused with Christ consciousness&#x2015;reverence, wisdom, peace, and love. <br><br> <i>&#x201c;An Unknown Destiny</i> is like a stream of fresh water in which all psychotherapeutic approaches would do well to immerse and possibly transform. Gruber&#x2019;s reading of the works of Nietzsche, Heidegger, and Steiner concerning the realm of terror that pervades our world, is not only a tour de force of reflection upon the writings of these seminal figures, but a clear and highly accessible one.

In this way, he locates the essential spiritual challenges from our greatest thinkers. Gruber has an appreciation of the mythic that approaches, at times, that of A.K. Coomaraswamy. But he does more. He shows how living thinking, the fresh experience of being, and the awakening from technology&#x2019;s hypnotic thrall, can all become realities for us. In doing so, Gruber clears a path for the self-aware individual to become no longer a passive recipient of mass culture, but a point source of love and wisdom.&#x201d; <p>&#x2015;<b>Michael Lipson</b>, Ph.D, psychotherapist, author of <i>Stairway of Surprise</i> </p><br>&#x201c;Michael Gruber has written a truly remarkable, courageous-beyond-belief book. He shows how modern psychology serves terrorist structures of consciousness. He further shows that only a truly spiritual psychology can break through these forms. His creative reading of Nietzsche opens the path of therapy as modern initiation. His work with Rudolf Steiner reveals the presence of pathologies of spirit that are still being approached as psychological difficulties; and how to approach them anew. Finally, his understanding of Heidegger shows the way to the imaginal reality of the unity of person&#x2013;world.

Auel</h2><p>Forced to leave the Clan and her young son, Ayla sets out alone to travel the frigid steppes until she finds the valley of horses. Unable to find people like herself, the Cro-Magnons, she settles there and seeks friendship elsewhere. First she adopts a young filly, then a wounded lion cub. But far to the west, two young Cro-Magnon brothers have begun a journey. One of them is Jondalar, whose destiny is bound inextricably with Ayla&#39;s. Jean Auel&#39;s imaginative reconstruction of pre-historic life, rich in detail of language, culture, myth and ritual, has become a set text in schools and colleges around the world.</p><p>Here is an unforgettable odyssey into a world of awesome mysteries, into a distant past made vividly real, a novel that carries us back to the exotic, primeval world we experienced in <i>The Clan Of The Cave Bear</i> -- and to beautiful Ayla, the bold woman who captivates us with her fierce courage and questing heart. Cruelly cast out by the ancient Clan that adopted her as a child, Ayla now travels alone in a land of glacial cold and terrifying beasts. She is searching for the Others, a race as tall, blond, and blue-eyed as she. But Ayla finds only a hidden valley, where a herd of hardy steppe horses roams. Here, she is granted a unique kinship with animals, enabling her to learn the secrets of fire and raw survival -- but still, her need for human companionship and love remains unfulfilled. then fate brings her a stranger, handsome Jondolar, and Ayla is torn between fear and hope -- and carried to an awakening of desire that would shape the future of mankind.<p> "Shiningly intense... Sheer storytelling skill holds the reader in a powerful spell." -- <i>Publishers Weekly</i></p>This unforgettable odyssey into the distant past carries us back to the awesome mysteries of the exotic, primeval world of The Clan of the Cave Bear, and to Ayla, now grown into a beautiful and courageous young woman. <br>Cruelly cast out by the new leader of the ancient Clan that adopted her as a child, Ayla leaves those she loves behind and travels alone through a stark, open land filled with dangerous animals but few people, searching for the Others, tall and fair like herself. The short summer gives her little time to look, and when she finds a sheltered valley with a herd of hardy steppe horses, she decides to stay and prepare for the long glacial winter ahead. Living with the Clan has taught Ayla many skills but not real hunting. She finally knows she can survive when she traps a horse, which gives her meat and a warm pelt for the winter, but fate has bestowed a greater gift, an orphaned foal with whom she develops a unique kinship. One winter extends to more; she discovers a way to make fire more quickly and a wounded cave lion cub joins her unusual family, but her beloved animals don't fulfill her restless need for human companionship. Then she hears the sound of a man screaming in pain. She saves tall, handsome Jondalar, who brings her a language to speak and an awakening of love and desire, but Ayla is torn between her fear of leaving her valley and her hope of living with her own kind.</p><h2>La Vampirata (Spanish Edition)</h2><p>Deep in the dense Colombian jungle a mysterious emerald has been plundered by an odd band of backstabbing pirates.

He published his first novel Casino Royale in 1953 and thus started the astoundingly successful James Bond novels and films. Fleming died in 1964.<p><b>1. SEASCAPE WITH FIGURES</b></p> <p>The five-mile promenade of Royale-les-Eaux, backed by trim lawns emblazoned at intervals with tricolour beds of salvia, alyssum and lobelia, was bright with flags and, on the longest beach in the north of France, the gay bathing tents still marched prettily down to the tide-line in big, money-making battalions. Music, one of those lilting accordion waltzes, blared from the loud-speakers around the Olympic-size piscine and, from time to time, echoing above the music, a man's voice announced over the public address system that Phil-ippe Bertrand, aged seven, was looking for his mother, that Yolande Lefevre was waiting for her friends below the clock at the entrance, or that a Madame Dufours was demanded on the telephone. From the beach, particularly from the neighbourhood of the three play-ground enclosures - 'Joie de Vivre', 'Helio' and 'Azur' - came a twitter of children's cries that waxed and waned with the thrill of their games and, farther out, on the firm sand left by the now distant sea, the shrill whistle of the physical-fitness instructor marshalled his teenagers through the last course of the day.</p> <p>It was one of those beautiful, naive seaside panoramas for which the Brittany and Picardy beaches have provided the setting - and inspired their recorders, Boudin, Tissot, Monet - ever since the birth of plages and bains de mer more than a hundred years ago.</p> <p>To James Bond, sitting in one of the concrete shelters with his face to the setting sun, there was something poignant, ephemeral about it all. It reminded him almost too vividly of childhood - of the velvet feel of the hot powder sand, and the painful grit of wet sand between young toes when the time came for him to put his shoes and socks on, of the precious little pile of sea-shells and interesting wrack on the sill of his bedroom window ('No, we'll have to leave that behind, darling. It'll dirty up your trunk!'), of the small crabs scuttling away from the nervous fingers groping beneath the seaweed in the rock-pools, of the swimming and swimming and swimming through the dancing waves -always in those days it seemed, lit with sunshine - and then the infuriating, inevitable 'time to come out'. It was all there, his own childhood, spread out before him to have another look at. What a long time ago they were, those spade-and-bucket days! How far he had come since the freckles and the Cadbury milk chocolate Flakes and the fizzy lemonade! Impatiently Bond lit a cigarette, pulled his shoulders out of their slouch and slammed the mawkish memories back into their long-closed file. Today he was a grown-up, a man with years of dirty, dangerous memories - a spy. He was not sitting in this concrete hideout to sentimentalise about a pack of scrubby, smelly children on a beach scattered with bottle-tops and lolly-sticks and fringed by a sea thick with sun-oil and putrid with the main drains of Royale. He was here, he had chosen to be here, to spy. To spy on a woman.</p> <p>The sun was getting lower. Already one could smell the September chill that all day had lain hidden beneath the heat. The cohorts of bathers were in quick retreat, striking their little camps and filtering up the steps and across the promenade into the shelter of the town where the lights were going up in the cafes. The announcer at the swimming-pool harried his customers: 'Allo! Allo! Fermeture en dix minutes! A dix-huit heures, fermeture de la piscine!' Silhouetted in the path of the setting sun, the two Bombard rescue-boats with flags bearing a blue cross on a yellow background were speeding northwards for their distant shelter up-river in the Vieux Port. The last of the gay, giraffe-like sand-yachts fled down the distant water-line towards its corral among the sand dunes, and the three agents cyclistes in charge of the car-parks pedalled away through the melting ranks of cars towards the police station in the centre of the town. In a matter of minutes the vast expanse of sand - the tide, still receding, was already a mile out - would be left to the seagulls that would soon be flocking in their hordes to forage for the scraps of food left by the picnickers. Then the orange ball of the sun would hiss down into the sea and the beach would, for a while, be entirely deserted, until, under cover of darkness, the prowling lovers would come to writhe briefly, grittily in the dark corners between the bathing-huts and the sea-wall.</p> <p>On the beaten stretch of sand below where James Bond was sitting, two golden girls in exciting bikinis packed up the game of Jokari which they had been so provocatively playing, and raced each other up the steps towards Bond's shelter. They flaunted their bodies at him, paused and chattered to see if he would respond, and, when he didn't, linked arms and sauntered on towards the town, leaving Bond wondering why it was that French girls had more prominent navels than any others. Was it that French surgeons sought to add, even in this minute respect, to the future sex-appeal of girl babies?</p> <p>And now, up and down the beach, the lifeguards gave a final blast on their horns to announce that they were going off duty, the music from the piscine stopped in mid-tune and the great expanse of sand was suddenly deserted.</p> <p>But not quite! A hundred yards out, lying face down-wards on a black and white striped bathing-wrap, on the private patch of firm sand where she had installed herself an hour before, the girl was still there, motion-less, spread-eagled in direct line between James Bond and the setting sun that was now turning the left-behind pools and shallow rivulets into blood-red, meandering scrawls across the middle distance. Bond went on watching her - now, in the silence and emptiness, with an ounce more tension. He was waiting for her to do something - for something, he didn't know what, to happen. It would be more true to say that he was watching over her. He had an instinct that she was in some sort of danger. Or was it just that there was the smell of danger in the air? He didn't know. He only knew that he mustn't leave her alone, particularly now that everyone else had gone.</p> <p>James Bond was mistaken. Not everyone else had gone. Behind him, at the Cafe de la Plage on the other side of the promenade, two men in raincoats and dark caps sat at a secluded table bordering the sidewalk. They had half-empty cups of coffee in front of them and they didn't talk. They sat and watched the blur on the frosted-glass partition of the shelter that was James Bond's head and shoulders. They also watched, but less intently, the distant white blur on the sand that was the girl. Their stillness, and their unseasonable clothes, would have made a disquieting impression on anyone who, in his turn, might have been watching them. But there was no such person, except their waiter who had simply put them in the category of 'bad news' and hoped they would soon be on their way.</p> <p>When the lower rim of the orange sun touched the sea, it was almost as if a signal had sounded for the girl. She slowly got to her feet, ran both hands backwards through her hair and began to walk evenly, purposefully towards the sun and the far-away froth of the water-line over a mile away. It would be violet dusk by the time she reached the sea and one might have guessed that this was probably the last day of her holiday, her last bathe.</p> <p>James Bond thought otherwise. He left his shelter, ran down the steps to the sand and began walking out after her at a fast pace. Behind him, across the promenade, the two men in raincoats also seemed to think otherwise. One of them briskly threw down some coins and they both got up and, walking strictly in step, crossed the promenade to the sand and, with a kind of urgent military precision, marched rapidly side by side in Bond's tracks.</p> <p>Now the strange pattern of figures on the vast expanse of empty, blood-streaked sand was eerily conspicuous. Yet it was surely not one to be interfered with! The pattern had a nasty, a secret smell. The white girl, the bare-headed young man, the two squat, marching pursuers - it had something of a kind of deadly Grand-mother's Steps about it. In the cafe, the waiter collected the coins and looked after the distant figures, still outlined by the last quarter of the orange sun. It smelt like police business - or the other thing. He would keep it to himself but remember it. He might get his name in the papers.</p> <p>James Bond was rapidly catching up with the girl. Now he knew that he would get to her just as she reached the waterline. He began to wonder what he would say to her, how he would put it. He couldn't say, 'I had a hunch you were going to commit suicide so I came after you to stop you.' 'I was going for a walk on the beach and I thought I recognised you. Will you have a drink after your swim?' would be childish. He l finally decided to say,' Oh, Tracy!' and then, when she turned round, 'I was worried about you.' Which would at least be inoffensive and, for the matter of that, true.</p> <p>The sea was now gunmetal below a primrose horizon. A small, westerly offshore breeze, drawing the hot land-air out to sea, had risen and was piling up wavelets that scrolled in whitely as far as the eye could see. Flocks of herring gulls lazily rose and settled again at the girl's approach, and the air was full of their mewing and of the endless lap-lap of the small waves. The soft indigo dusk added a touch of melancholy to the empty solitude of sand and sea, now so far away from the comforting bright lights and holiday bustle of 'La Reine de la Cote Opale', as Royale-les-Eaux had splendidly christened herself. Bond looked forward to getting the girl back to those bright lights. He watched the lithe golden figure in the white one-piece bathing-suit and wondered how soon she would be able to hear his voice above the noise of the gulls and the sea. Her pace had slowed a fraction as she approached the water-line and her head, with its bell of heavy fair hair to the shoulders, was slightly bowed, in thought perhaps, or tiredness.</p> <p>Bond quickened his step until he was on...</p></p><h2>CHASED BY DEMONS: How I Survived Hitler&#39;s Madness In My Native France</h2><p>On June 14, 1940, eight-year-old Jacqueline witnesses the Nazis march into her beloved, native Paris.

Noise as art, music, cultural or digital practice is a way of intervening so that it can be harnessed for an aesthetic expression not caught within mainstream styles or distribution.</p><p>This wide-ranging book examines the concept and practices of noise, treating noise not merely as a sonic phenomenon but as an essential component of all communication and information systems. The book opens with ideas of what noise is, and then works through ideas of how noise works in contemporary media, to conclude by showing potentials within noise for a continuing cultural renovation through experimentation. Considered in this way, noise is seen as an essential yet excluded element of contemporary culture that demands a rigorous engagement. <i>Reverberations </i>brings together a range of perspectives, case studies, critiques and suggestions as to how noise can mobilize thought and cultural activity through a heightening of critical creativity.Written by a strong, international line-up of scholars and artists, <i>Reverberations</i> looks to energize this field of study and initiate debates for years to come.</p></p><p><p><b>Dr Michael Goddard</b> is Lecturer in Media Studies at the University of Salford.

Pye reconceptualizes Asian political development as a product of cultural attitudes about power and authority. He contrasts the great traditions of Confucian East Asia with the Southeast Asian cultures and the South Asian traditions of Hinduism and Islam, and explores the national differences within these larger civilizations.</p><p>Breaking with modern political theory, Pye believes that power differs profoundly from one culture to another. In Asia the masses of the people are group-oriented and respectful of authority, while their leaders are more concerned with dignity and upholding collective pride than with problem-solving. As culture decides the course of political development, Pye shows how Asian societies, confronted with the task of setting up modern nation-states, respond by fashioning paternalistic forms of power that satisfy their deep psychological craving for security. This new paternalism may appear essentially authoritarian to Western eyes, but Pye maintains that it is a valid response to the people&#x2019;s needs and will ensure community solidarity and strong group loyalties. He predicts that we are certain to see emerging from Asia&#x2019;s accelerating transformation some new version of modern society that may avoid many of the forms of tension common to Western civilization but may also produce a whole new set of problems.</p><p>This book revitalizes Asian political studies on a plane that comprehends the large differences between Asia and the West and at the same time is sensitive to the subtle variations among the many Asian cultures. Its comparative perspective will provide indispensable insights to anyone who wishes to think more deeply about the modern Asian states.</p></p><p>Lucian W.

Pye contends that those political scientists who study the nature of power have erred in treating it as a universal concept... Central to Pye&#x2019;s thesis is his contrasting of the Western concept of individual autonomy with the Eastern concept of dependency on an idealized, benevolent, authoritarian leadership.

Drawing on firsthand reporting from war zones around the world, David Rieff shows us what aid workers do in the field and the growing gap between their noble ambitions and their actual capabilities for alleviating suffering. He describes how many humanitarian organizations have moved from their founding principle of neutrality, which gave them access to victims, to encouraging the international community to take action to stop civil wars and ethnic cleansing. By calling for intervention, humanitarian organizations risk being seen as taking sides in a conflict and thus jeopardizing their access to victims. And by overreaching, the humanitarian movement has allowed itself to be hijacked by the major powers. Rieff concludes that if humanitarian organizations are to do what they do best -- alleviate suffering -- they must reclaim their independence.</p><p>David Rieff is the author of eight previous books, including <i>Swimming in a Sea of Death</i>, <i>At the Point of a Gun: Democratic Dreams and Armed Intervention</i>; <i>A Bed for the Night: Humanitarianism in Crisis</i>; and <i>Slaughterhouse: Bosnia and the Failure of the West</i>. He lives in New York City.<b>Chapter 1: The Humanitarian Paradox</b> <p> You are the prosperous citizen of a prosperous country. In practice, this means you are almost certainly a citizen of the United States, Canada, Japan, or one of the countries of the European Union. It also means that, in global terms, you belong to a minority group, at most no more than a tenth of the world's population, and probably a good deal less. Of course, it is a minority of privilege, not of oppression. You, or, to be more accurate, we (I belong to this group too), have the habit of spending at least part of your mornings reading a decent broadsheet newspaper and part of most evenings watching your national television news program. The particular newspaper or TV broadcast is not all that relevant to the scenario that I am trying to construct. After all, when viewed from the perspective of Central Africa, or the slums of Rio de Janeiro, or the jungles of the southern Philippines, or the mountains of Afghanistan, the differences between <i>The New York Times</i> and <i>Le Monde,</i> CNN and TV Espa�a, don't amount to very much. What counts is that your habit of reading a newspaper and, above all, of watching the news on television means that you voluntarily expose yourself on a regular basis to at least some of the most horrible things taking place in the world. </p><p> If there is a refugee crisis in Burundi, a famine in Somalia, or a war in the Balkans, the fact that you are a faithful consumer of the news will lead to your being confronted by at least some tiny corner of them. To be sure, that exposure is usually both fleeting and superficial. To anyone who knows a subject in any depth, television news, even at its best, seems like reality doled out with an eye-dropper for someone assumed to have the attention span of a gnat. Nowhere is this more true than in the coverage of humanitarian crises, in large measure because no other story that gets any airtime or major newspaper attention at all is so dependably unfamiliar. Somalia, Rwanda, Bosnia, Kosovo, East Timor, Afghanistan -- these are places that capture the attention of mainstream, nonspecialist journalists only when a disaster is taking place. </p><p> That in itself is a recipe for distortion and misapprehension. The idea that we live in a "global village" was first popularized by the Canadian futurist Marshall McLuhan and then repeated ad nauseam during the great stock market bubble of the 1990s in the form of paeans to globalization and the new "wired" world. This clich� is true and false at the same time. It is true that we have unprecedented access to information thanks to television and the Internet. But it is false that this information necessarily means we understand what we are seeing in any usable way. You can know that there is a famine in southern Sudan. You can wish that it weren't happening, and hope that something will be done about it. But what do you understand about southern Sudan from the images of horror and want that you see on your television screen? Just that there is horror and want, nothing else. You are watching something take place in southern Sudan, but apart from the fact that the people are black, how do you distinguish what you are seeing from something going on in Afghanistan, or East Timor, or Central America? There is horror, but no context, and therefore as much mystification as information results from this new way of accessing the world's tragedies. </p><p> The average international story on national television news in the United States lasts one minute and twenty seconds. On that basis alone, it appears almost inevitable that there will be misreporting, even if inadvertent, on the journalist's side and misunderstanding on the viewer's. In Europe, the rhythm is slightly less impatient and commercially driven, but even there such stories rarely clock in at more than three minutes. And what can one say in eighty or ninety seconds or in three minutes? Perhaps it is easier to predict what one cannot say. It is difficult to say something original; it is difficult to explain anything in depth; and it is difficult not to fall into the same clich�s about humanitarian disasters that were employed during the last disaster, thus leaching the crisis one is covering of all its tragic specificity. You, the viewer, are not in Afghanistan, Cambodia, or Bosnia so much as you are in humanitarian-tragedy land -- a world of wicked warlords, suffering and <i>innocent</i> victims, and noble aid workers. And whether you know why or not, you have the distinct impression that you have been there before. </p><p> It could hardly be otherwise. Given the way humanitarian emergencies are covered, what other impression can the viewer retain but the feeling that out there in the poor world there is a planet of sufferers? The television camera operator's stock-in-trade in a famine or a war is the close-up -- the focus on the baby in the aid worker's arms, the child with flies lighting on her face, the vultures slyly approaching the rotting corpse of the dead militiaman. But the effect on the viewer is to encourage him or her to see this world in long shot. He or she becomes unable to differentiate one person in pain from another, much as someone standing on a high hill will have trouble making out the physiognomy of people in the valley below. </p><p> To point this out is not to blame either the media or the audience, let alone the aid workers, whose symbiotic relationship with the media is one of their greatest challenges. These crises <i>are</i> far away and difficult to understand, and human beings are not solidarity machines or professional carers, however much we might wish it otherwise. It is not even clear that if the media were given more time and resources, were permitted to be more deliberate and more serious, people could cope psychologically or morally with the reality of the poor world in all its horror, rage, and complexity. To sympathize in the way that the television images invite us all to do is not difficult. It is with the question of how that sympathy can be translated into action that the problems arise. Does having seen images of starving babies really allow people to come to any kind of informed view about whether there should be an airlift of food, or political engagement, or even a military intervention? And even assuming that the atrocious images of famine do provoke a military intervention, as was the case in Somalia in 1992, is it not inevitable that the public will be utterly unprepared for that intervention to have costs other than financial ones? </p><p> In Somalia, this battle of images was soon joined. First there were the images of the famine. As Philip Johnston, former president of the relief group CARE USA, put it in his memoir, <i>Somalia Diary,</i> "Television brought home the urgency of Somalia's tragedy, translating a faraway crisis into a story of human beings who were days, perhaps hours, away from death." As an example of this, he cited an ABC report in which the reporter described a young Somali girl who was "little more than a walking skeleton." As Johnston writes, the point of the story was clear: "As long as marauders kept food from reaching those who needed it most, relief workers would have nothing to offer the most vulnerable." </p><p> Johnston's own role in the humanitarian crisis in Somalia was extraordinarily important. Some aid workers believe that he was the driving force behind the militarization of the humanitarian aid effort in the country and the eventual decision by the U.S. government to send in military forces. At the time, he said that if necessary we would "have to fight the Somalis themselves" to make sure the aid got delivered. But what is noteworthy about Johnston's account is something that has become an integral part of the humanitarian repertory, even in crises where there is no question of military force being deployed. His account of the media's role in helping make the American public aware of the crisis is largely devoid of historical context, geographical specificity, and even any real personalization. There is a starving girl, unnamed; there are marauders, unidentified; and there are relief workers, also unspecified. When Johnston speaks approvingly of the media's ability to turn a faraway crisis into a story of human beings, it is hard not to feel that he means human beings in the generic sense. After all, there are no real individuals in the story -- only victims, victimizers, and relief workers who want to help and urgently need the means, which for Johnston at the time meant military force to escort the relief convoys and fight the Somalis who preyed on them. </p><p> Johnston was successful in persuading the United Nations to take a more militarized approach to the crisis, and in getting the administration of George Bush senior to commit U.S. troops. And the result was almost inevitable: He who lives by the image, dies by the image. Because of the sympathy these images Johnston approved of had evoked, the American public supported the decision to intervene. Such sympathy may license actions that cost money; it never licenses actions that cost lives. The American public thought its troops were in Somalia on a humanitarian mission -- that is, to do good, not to kill, and certainly not to get killed. And yet to the leading Somali warlord, Mohammed Farah Aidid, the U.S. troops were there to thwart his effort to seize power. From his perspective, their mission was political -- that is, to attack him. </p><p> And attack they did. But while Aidid could never match the military power of the United States, his fighters in Mogadishu, the Somali capital, soon proved that they were more than a match for the Americans in resolve and determination. On October 3, 1993, they responded to the attempt of American elite forces to seize two of Aidid's lieutenants by shooting down two American helicopters, killing eighteen U.S. soldiers and wounding seventy-seven others. That evening, American television viewers were shocked to see jubilant Somalis dragging the naked bodies of two American helicopter pilots through the dust of Mogadishu. That image far outweighed the im...</p></p><h2>Under the Healing Sign</h2><p>In the sequel to The Magic and the Healing, veterinarian BJ Vaughan once again brings the benefits of modern medicine to the fantasy creatures and copes with the destructive forces that have entered Crossroads.

There was a lot of talk about the "rapture." Though the word did not actually appear in the Bible, I found it was commonly used to describe that time when believers would be "caught up...in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air" (1 Thes. 4:17). But the question was: Would this catching up or rapture be a separate event from the return of Christ at the end of the age? <p>According to the dispensational outline, Christ would return in two separate events--first in the air, before the tribulation, to gather his own (the rapture)-and then, at the end of the tribulation period, he would come again, this time openly and in glory (the revelation). Thus the rapture was set in contrast to the revelation and TWO second comings (or two stages of the second coming) were taught. </p><p>I once read the entire New Testament through to see if I could find any scriptures that taught the return of Jesus would be in two stages. After carefully searching, I could find none. </p><p>In time I would learn that not only was the two-stage return of Christ not found in the Bible, according to history it was not taught during the early centuries of the church; it was not taught by any of the reformers such as Luther, Calvin, or Wesley; it was not taught by anyone until around a century and a half ago! It has been a puzzle to me how some will contend for the old-time faith in other areas, yet hold a viewpoint that did not surface until comparatively modern times concerning the return of Christ.</p>In addition to authoring over a dozen books, Ralph Woodrow has had the opportunity to speak for many Churches and groups of various denominations during 40 years of ministry--including camp meetings, conventions and conferences. Through a unique set of circumstances he was put into the ministry at age 18. His ministry began in Canada, where he went as a pianist for an evangelist--but soon several Churches and groups opened their doors for Ralph to preach extended revival meetings. When he returned home after a few of months of ministry in Canada, God continued to open doors for him to preach the Gospel--holding revivals at many Churches and denominational rallies. As a single man of 21 he felt led to hold tent revivals and also to preach on the radio, with good results from both. From these early beginnings sprang an inter-denominational ministry, through which many effective doors of ministry open to this day. <p>In his early teens, he began to search the Scriptures--becoming intrigued to discover things in the Bible that he hadn't been taught. Similarly, he began to discover that some of the things he had been taught were not in the Bible. Ralph memorized hundreds of Scriptures as a teenager--his whole life revolved around studying God's Word and seeking God's will for his life. He preached his first sermon when he was 15 in their local Church. He spent much time at the Church, doing anything he could to serve the Lord--mowing the lawns, cleaning the Church, praying, and attending the meetings where he grew in the Spirit-filled life. </p><p>Throughout his ministry, in addition to preaching the Gospel at large, he has shared neglected biblical truths. AS AN AUTHOR, he is known for his scholarly research, along with his emphasis on the importance of love and unity. He emphasizes that if Christians disagree on some points of doctrine--they should disagree agreeably--knowing that all Christians agree on more than they disagree. Books he has authored total over a half million in print. Also, he has shared printed sermons with a select list--since 1961. Woodrow was born in San Jacinto, California and grew up in nearby Riverside. He and his wife, Arlene who is also a minister and writer, minister in various capacities locally in addition to periodically ministering throughout the U.S., and sometimes in Canada. </p><p>FREE-learn more about Woodrow's ministry.

This is an OCR edition with typos. Excerpt from book: CHAPTER III. LAW OF NATURE AND EQUITY The theory of a set of legal principles entitled by their intrinsic superiority to supersede the older law, very early obtained currency both in the Roman State and in England. Such a body of principles, existing in any system, has in the foregoing chapters been denominated Equity, a term which, as will presently be seen, was one (though only one) of the designations by which this agent of legal change was known to the Roman jurisconsults. The jurisprudence of the Court of Chancery, which bears the name of Equity in England, could only be adequately discussed in a separate treatise. It is extremely complex in its texture, and derives its materials from several heterogeneous sources. The early ecclesiastical chancellors contributed to it, from the Canon Law, many of the principles which lie deepest in its structure. The Roman law, more fertile than the Canon Law in rules applicable to secular disputes, was not seldom resorted to by a later generation of Chancery judges, amid whose recorded dicta we often find entire texts from the Corpus Juris Civilisimbedded, with their terms unaltered, though their origin is never acknowledged. Still more recently, and particularly at the middle and during the latter half of the eighteenth century, the mixed systems of jurisprudence and morals constructed by the publicists of the Low Countries appear to have been much studied by English lawyers, and from the chancellorship of Lord Talbot to the commencement of Lord Eldon&#39;s chancellorship these works had considerable effect on the rulings of the Court of Chancery. The system, which obtained its ingredients from these various quarters, was greatly controlled in its growth by the necessity imposed on it of conforming itself to the analogies of the common l...</p><p>This book is engrossing reading for all who may be interested in the growth of human ideas and the origins of human society. Its object is to reveal some of the earliest ideas of mankind, reflected in Ancient Law, to point out the relation of those ideas to later thought. Early society, reflected in the law, begins with the group (the family), not with the individual. Covered are: ancient codes; legal fictions; law of nature and equity; the modern history of the law of nature; primitive society and ancient law; the early history of testamentary succession; ancient and modern ideas respecting wills and successions; the early history of property, contract, and delict and crime.English lawyer and historian SIR HENRY JAMES SUMNER MAINE (1822-1888) lectured on legal issues at Oxford and Cambridge and contributed to the codification of law in India.

Hughes continues to carve out a unique place for himself in the fantasy-mystery realm with his superlative third adventure featuring Holmesian �&#x20ac;&#x153;discriminator�&#x20ac; Henghis Hapthorn. Still recovering from the events of 2007's <i>The Spiral Labyrinth</i>, Hapthorn is granted a glimpse into the future and learns that the world as he knows it will soon be overtaken by magical forces. Despite the impending catastrophe, the investigator attempts to carry on with his usual assignments, but after he successfully recovers some stolen relics, he finds himself caught in a war between his vengeful client and the criminal he ransomed them from.

Every year she takes a trip to collect images for her beautiful collages. She lives in Maine.Part faux diary, part scrapbook, this charming volume teeters between picture book and novel. Through the 1892 "journal" of young Charlotte Glidden, daughter of a fictitious Boston painter, Knight (Bon App?tit, Bertie) uncovers the inner workings of an artist's colony that sprang up near Claude Monet's home in France. Charlotte's enthusiastic, detailed reports emulate the more leisurely pace of 19th-century daily life in Giverny, and her perceptions of French culture and customs, art and artists give readers the distinct feeling of looking over her shoulder. Knight adroitly pins the substance of her tale to 16 Impressionist paintings, some of which are attributed to characters in the book. For instance, Charlotte describes her friend Edith Perry sitting for a portrait her mother is painting, and the painter turns out to be Lilla Cabot Perry. Similarly, Theodore Robinson's The Wedding March appears in Charlotte's diary entry about the marriage of Suzanne Monet to American artist Theodore Butler. Knight also works in paintings by other Impressionists who don't appear in the narrative but who did spend time at Giverny, such as an unusually informal painting by John Singer Sargent, Carnation, Lily, Lily, Rose. Sweet (Leaving Vietnam) adds to the visual mix with a whimsical patchwork of sprightly watercolors and small-scale collages made from scraps of fabric, stamps, period photographs, a mini-picture glossary of French words and the like. Closing with a brief description of each painting and biography of each artist, this is a most appealing art history lesson.

For the moment, though, his primary responsibility is to enjoy himself, a task at which he excels &#x2013; bedding society beauties, betting on sporting events, tormenting his long-suffering wife, and taking his royal bulk off to other people&#x2019;s country estates, there to shoot things, eat enormous meals, and goose the occasional serving maid. It is at just such an estate that the story unfolds, though this is no ordinary shooting-party. The guest-list, of course, is glittering, featuring a famous lady explorer, a beautiful actress, and several gentlemen known to be good with guns. Unfortunately, the guest-list dwindles rapidly, as one member after another turns up dead, but Bertie greets the murders with a certain delight, as they allow him to exercise his passion for amateur sleuthing (a task at which he doesn&#x2019;t particularly excel). Lovesey wrote Seven Bodies as an homage to Agatha Christie, but he laced his classically structured puzzle with his own sly, irresistible wit, gleefully poking fun at the pomposities of privilege. A Prince of Wales Mystery</p><p>No Bio<br><br>No BioWhen a killer stalks a dinner-and-gameshooting party on an English country estate, the corpses drop like pheasants. High-living Albert Edward ("Bertie"), Prince of Wales, who made his detective debut in Lovesey's Bertie and the Tinman , is the fumbling sleuth and rakish narrator, loosely modeled on the real-life prince who became King Edward VII. Bertie discovers that the nursery rhyme "Monday's child is fair of face . . . " holds the key; each line of the poem points to the next victim. Among the dwindling group of party guests, one of whom is the murderer, are an Amazon explorer, a stuttering poet and a scheming actress. Half the fun of this romp lies in watching Bertie invent, then discard, one theory after another; for a while his suspicions even fall on the widowed hostess he wants to bed. The other half comes from Lovesey's light mockery of Victorian manners and sexual mores in a bright, entertaining tale whose bantering tone conceals artful plotting. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Mathematical Methods for Physics &amp; Engineering - Student Solutions Manual (3rd, 06) by Riley, K F - Hobson, M P [Paperback (2006)]</h2><p>Please Read Notes: Brand New, International Softcover Edition, Printed in black and white pages, minor self wear on the cover or pages, Sale restriction may be printed on the book, but Book name, contents, and author are exactly same as Hardcover Edition.

She demonstrates that there are more similarities than differences in how people of different cultures celebrate the sacred nature of the Earth in literature, mythology, religion, and art. Includes hundreds of traditional and modern examples of literature and art, illustrated with b&amp;w and color photos. Annotation copyright Book News, Inc. Portland, Or.</p><p>In this fascinating collection, a filmmaker and author of books on American Indian life (including Touch the Earth, LJ 1/15/72) brings together excerpts from the works of poets, novelists, essayists, philosophers, and ethnologists of six different cultures to show how empathy with the earth can take "precedence over the impulse to exploit." An initial chapter outlines commonalities in the traditional cultures of the Australian aborigines, the Japanese, the Greeks, various African tribes, the Kogi of Colombia, and Native North Americans. Subsequent chapters examine each culture's understanding and celebration of their lands. What emerges are portraits of peoples not so much concerned with nature in the abstract as devoted to and fused with their particular landscapes, whether these are as grandly beautiful as Mount Fuji or as humble as a handful of dry soil. This is not a book to be read through from cover to cover. McLuhan's technique of breaking the collection into short thematic chapters results in repetitious reintroductions to quoted authors, and her analyses lack the depth and clarity of works by scholars like Mircea Eliade or Joseph Campbell. Instead, McLuhan offers readers eloquent glimpses of the primacy of place in cultures not yet submerged by shopping malls and superhighways. A suitable purchase for most libraries.<br><i>Joan S. Elbers, formerly with Montgomery Coll., Rockville, Md.</i><br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.McLuhan's bold, stimulating survey of how the world's cultures have struggled to make sense of their place in the universe should be as popular as her books on Native Americans ( Touch the Earth, etc.). She identifies underlying common themes in six disparate traditions: Greece, where Gaia, the Earth Mother, dominated pre-Hellenic myths; Japan, whose ancient ethos emphasized an emotional conjunction with nature and ecological awareness; aboriginal Australia, where "The Dreaming"--an otherworld peopled with mythic spirit-beings--gives meaning to life; Africa, where many inhabitants recognize a spiritual force-field linking humans, nature, gods, ancestors; the Kogi tribe of Colombia, who believe they are guardians of life on Earth; and Native North Americans, who "enter sacredness" via rituals and holy sites. This exuberantly multicultural synthesis detects spiritual consonances among Greek novelist Nikos Kazantzakis, West African global theorist Amadou Hampate Ba of Mali, Aboriginal writer Loraine Mafi Williams and Kiowan novelist-painter N.

Many Americans regarded him as a monster, while in the USSR he was viewed at various times as either hero or traitor. But what was he really like, and what did he really think?

In the first volume, published in 2004, Khrushchev takes his story up to the close of World War II. In the first section of this second volume, he covers the period from 1945 to 1956, from the famine and devastation of the immediate aftermath of the war to Stalin&#x2019;s death, the subsequent power struggle, and the Twentieth Party Congress. The remaining sections are devoted to Khrushchev&#x2019;s recollections and thoughts about various domestic and international problems. In the second and third sections, he recalls the virgin lands and other agricultural campaigns and his dealings with nuclear scientists and weapons designers. He also considers other sectors of the economy, specifically construction and the provision of consumer goods, administrative reform, and questions of war, peace, and disarmament. In the last section, he discusses the relations between the party leadership and the intelligentsia.</p><p> Included among the Appendixes are the notebooks of Nina Petrovna Kukharchuk, Khrushchev&#x2019;s wife.</p></p><p>"Nikita Khrushchev was one of the most important political leaders of the twentieth century. Without his memoirs, neither the rise and fall of the Soviet Union nor the history of the Cold War can be fully understood.

He has written for national publications including The New York Times, Los Angeles Times, American Heritage and Historic Preservation.

A journalist and author of Cosmopolis: Yesterday's Cities of the Future (Transaction, 1990), Mansfield investigates New England's cultural history as it is expressed in local and personal memory. He covers local history and historical societies, local heroes and native sons, town meetings, and the transformation of the natural landscape and neighborhoods. Most of the essays concern New Hampshire, but towns and villages in Massachusetts--Lowell, Leominster, Boston, and Walden Pond--are included. The essays are linked by a prolog, epilog, and prefatory pieces that seem to say that modern culture is hollow because it does not include shared, personalized memories; however, these pieces are not cohesive like the essays themselves, which are absorbing and can stand alone. A solid addition to collections in New England and American history.<br><i>- Wendy Knickerbocker, Rhode Island Coll.

In ten provocative essays, Geoffrey Parker chronicles notable moments in fifteenth-, sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Europe when defeat was snatched from the jaws of victory. He paints a broad picture of empire, war, and religion in the early modern world.Parker groups his material into three sections. In the first, he examines the rise and fall of the first global empire, the Spanish Empire. In the second, he shows how the spread of the Western military innovation triggered resistance stronger than it could overcome. Finally, he tells of the failure of the Reformation to grow beyond its original, urban milieu.Success Is Never Final offers a rich and original view of the fluctuations of power in early modern Europe, and bold new thinking from one of our master historians.</p><p><b>Geoffrey Parker</b> is Andreas Dorpalen Professor of History at Ohio State University, and previously held chairs at Yale University, the University of Illinois, the University of British Columbia, and at St. Andrews in Great Britain. The author or editor of thirty books, including The Military Revolution, The Dutch Revolt, and The Grand Strategy of Philip II, he is also a Fellow of the British Academy, a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Isabel the Catholic, and Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Alfonso the Wise. He lives in Columbus, Ohio.Movements, ideas, and empires that had great initial success but quickly flamed out litter the history of modern Europe. Award-winning historian Parker, who has taught early modern European history at Cambridge, Yale, and, most recently, Ohio State University, examines a few ideas and political figures whose staying powers were disappointing after a promising beginning. The series of essays collected for this book examines such diverse topics as the Spanish Empire of Phillip II, the lack of success of the Protestant church in rural Europe, and the artillery fortress and its role in European expansion. In the introduction, Parker argues that history finds its own equilibrium and that brilliant early success seldom lasts. All of Parker's contributions display a gift for taking complex historical ideas and making them comprehensible to the interested reader. As with any essay collection, some are closer to the original thesis than others, but all are brilliantly written and worth reading whether they help Parker's cause or not. One quibble is the lack of helpful maps. Recommended for academic libraries and larger public libraries. Randall L. Schroeder, Wartburg Coll.

Martha&#x2019;s world is turned topsy-turvy as she attempts to adjust to Skits, the exuberant, unabashed addition to the household. After the initial chaos, all seems to be going along quite smoothly until Skits does the unforgivable &#x2014; crashes into Martha&#x2019;s bowl of alphabet soup, spilling it everywhere. Martha decides she can no longer just watch from the safety of her chair. She must take charge and lay down the law for the pup. But when the family insists that Skits be more like Martha, something terrible happens! It&#x2019;s up to Martha to help Skits realize just how special he is.</p><p><p>Susan Meddaugh was born and raised in Montclair, New Jersey. She graduated from Wheaton College, where she studied French literature and fine arts. After working briefly with an advertising agency in New York, she moved to Boston and worked at a publishing company for ten years, first as a designer, then art editor, and finally as art director. While there, she did the illustrations for <i>Good Stones</i> (Houghton Mifflin) by Anne Epstein, and then decided to strike out on her own as a freelance illustrator and creator of children's books. Since that time, Susan has written and illustrated many popular books for children, including <i>Martha Speaks,</i> which was chosen as a <i>New York Times</i> Best Illustrated Book for 1992. In 1998 she was awarded the New England Book Award, given by the New England Booksellers Association to recognize a body of work. Her work also was acknowledged with a New York Times Best Illustrated Award. She lives in Sherborn, Massachusetts.</p>In this fifth Martha adventure, the talking dog hears a phrase well known to middle-aged pets: "Meet your new brother." Martha's owners introduce a brown puppy, Skits, who chews random household objects, attacks the vacuum cleaner and launches himself upon "anything airborne." ("Bad dog!" shout the humans, echoing the key line in Martha Walks the Dog, while Martha looks on in fond amusement.) Martha and Skits become friends, although Martha asserts "alpha dog" status when Skits spills her alphabet soup, the potion that enables Martha to speak. Martha wonders why the soup doesn't grant Skits the same ability ("Martha worried about Skits's brain. Was it too small?"), until she discerns that his talents lie elsewhere. Using her customary combination of deadpan commentary, comical voice-bubble asides and witty drawings, Meddaugh takes an accurate look at puppy behavior. It's almost a shame when, with the flick of a page, Skits transforms from big-eyed, charmingly stupid youngster to oversize lummox. Yet the gangly, full-grown SkitsDdashing headlong into big troubleDprovides an amusing contrast to tawny-coated, plump and pragmatic Martha. Meddaugh gently shifts the weight of the book away from Martha and onto the two dogs as a team. Her fitting addition to Martha's family acknowledges time's passage, invigorating both her canine heroine and her series. Ages 4-8.

To Emily Windsnap - half mermaid, half human - her new home is perfect. That is, until Emily ruins everything by waking a legendary sea monster known as the Kraken from its hundred-year sleep. As the Kraken rises from the deep, putting the future of the islanders in jeopardy, Emily makes a desperate attempt to save them. But how could she have dreamed that her best friend, Shona, would stop talking to her, or that Mandy Rushton, her old enemy from junior high, would turn up when least expected?</p><p>LIZ KESSLER&#39;s first book, THE TAIL OF EMILY WINDSNAP, was published in ten countries. Of EMILY WINDSNAP AND THE MONSTER FROM THE DEEP, she says, &#34;I always knew that Emily&#39;s story wasn&#39;t finished at the end of the first book. I really wanted to explore the idea of an island where humans and merfolk lived together in peace. I also knew that there was a detail I was missing. Then I happened to see an in-flight video about a theme park with a ride called the Kraken, and I instantly knew that this creature was the missing ingredient.&#34; Liz Kessler lives on a canal boat in the countryside just outside Manchester, England, where she is working on her third book, EMILY WINDSNAP AND THE CASTLE IN THE MIST.We swam side by side to begin with. Below us, occasional shoals of parrotfish and bright red snappers swept across the sandy bed. When the channel narrowed, I swam ahead, slinking along the silent passageway. The ground soon became uncluttered: clear golden sand beneath us, the sun shining down, almost directly above our heads. Two silhouetted mermaid figures gliding along below the surface, our shadows came and went, appearing briefly before suddenly growing distorted with the splash of a tail breaking the water's still surface.<br><br>We came to the curtain of reeds draped down the channel's walls and the algae-coated wooden plaques. That's when the feeling started inside me. I didn't know what it was. A quivery kind of sensation jiggling around in my stomach. Nervous. Waiting for something - and a feeling that there was something waiting for me, too. Trying not to let Shona see my quivering hands, I parted the curtain and looked through the hole in the wall. The water sparkled and fanned out into a wide lagoon. Ferns hung down over cracks and gaps in the walls. A white tropical bird flew into a hole behind me, its long tail disappearing into the rock. Nothing else moved. Shona stared. <br> <br>I turned to her. "Ready?" My voice shook.<br><br>She broke her gaze to look at me. "Let's just get this over with."<br> <br>I glanced around to check that no one had followed us, then I squeezed through the gap and swam into the lagoon. The sun burned down, heating my neck and dancing on the water. Its light rippled below us in wavy lines across the sea floor.<br><br>As we slid across the stillness, the water grew colder and murkier. When the lagoon narrowed back into a channel, I couldn't see my reflection swimming along below me anymore. The walls lining our trail had lost their hardness. They were like chalk. I stopped and scraped my finger down the side. I made myself focus on the walls, almost flicking a switch to turn off the nagging wordless worry in my mind. Rock crumbled in my hand. The channel walls stretched upward, cold and gray and deserted. <br><br>"Emily!" Shona was pointing at something ahead. An engraving on the wall: a perfect circle with a fountain spiraling out from the center. It looked like a pinwheel, full of energy, almost as tall as us. I had this weird feeling I knew the picture, recognized it. Had I seen it in a book? Dreamed about it? What was it?<br><br>"Look at this!" Shona had swum ahead while I stared at the engraving.<br><br>I joined her in front of some ferns loosely covering a hole in the rock. The hole disappeared below the surface. We dived down. Under the water, it was just big enough to swim into.<br><br>"Cool!" I grinned at her. A secret tunnel reaching into the rock!

He has Asperger&#39;s Syndrome, a form of autism. He is obsessed with maths, science and Sherlock Holmes but finds it hard to understand other people. When he discovers a dead dog on a neighbour&#39;s lawn he decides to solve the mystery and write a detective thriller about it. As in all good detective stories, however, the more he unearths, the deeper the mystery gets - for both Christopher and the rest of his family.</p><p>Mark Haddon's bitterly funny debut novel, <i>The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time</i>, is a murder mystery of sorts--one told by an autistic version of Adrian Mole. Fifteen-year-old Christopher John Francis Boone is mathematically gifted and socially hopeless, raised in a working-class home by parents who can barely cope with their child's quirks. He takes everything that he sees (or is told) at face value, and is unable to sort out the strange behavior of his elders and peers.<p> Late one night, Christopher comes across his neighbor's poodle, Wellington, impaled on a garden fork. Wellington's owner finds him cradling her dead dog in his arms, and has him arrested. After spending a night in jail, Christopher resolves--against the objection of his father and neighbors--to discover just who has murdered Wellington. He is encouraged by Siobhan, a social worker at his school, to write a book about his investigations, and the result--quirkily illustrated, with each chapter given its own prime number--is <i>The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time.</i></p><p> </p><p> Haddon's novel is a startling performance. This is the sort of book that could turn condescending, or exploitative, or overly sentimental, or grossly tasteless very easily, but Haddon navigates those dangers with a sureness of touch that is extremely rare among first-time novelists. <i>The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time</i> is original, clever, and genuinely moving: this one is a must-read. <i>--Jack Illingworth, Amazon.ca</i></p>"Mark Haddon's portrayal of an emotionally dissociated mind is a superb achievement.

She has written and illustrated Augustine, Chester, Chester&#39;s Back, Scaredy&#39;s many adventures and more. M�lanie is also afraid of vampire bats. She lives in Montreal, Quebec.Ages 2-5. Other chameleons change color, blending into their environments, but Leon is a standout--literally: on a green leaf, he turns red; on yellow sand, he turns purple. He's embarrassed, lonely, and, lacking camouflage, sometimes frightened. He just wants to fit in. When Leon and some fellow chameleons become lost on an outing, however, he discovers being different can have unexpected advantages. Watt uses simple prose and basic vocabulary (aside from <i>chameleon</i>) to convey a familiar, supportive message, which is buttressed by artwork in vibrant, eye-popping primary and complementary colors, shaded for depth. Spare line drawings of chameleons and an expansive landscape minimize details, further emphasizing colors and contrasts. An endnote, accompanied by a color wheel, briefly explains primary and complementary colors. Consequently, this is not only a comforting tale about being special but also a visually effective choice for children just learning colors. <i>Shelle Rosenfeld</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

The young woman has dreams of becoming a screenwriter, but the only job Julie&#x2019;s able to find is one in the studio publicity office of the notoriously demanding producer&nbsp;David O. Selznick, who is busy burning through directors, writers, and money as he films <i>Gone with the Wind</i>.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Although tensions run high on the set, Julie finds she can step onto the back lot, take in the smell of smoky gunpowder and the soft rustle of hoop skirts, and feel the magical world of <i>Gone with the Wind </i>come to life. Julie&#x2019;s access to real-life magic comes when&nbsp;Carole Lombard hires her as an assistant and invites her into the glamorous world Carole shares with Clark Gable, who is about to move into movie history as the dashing Rhett Butler.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carole Lombard, happily profane and uninhibited,&nbsp;makes no secret of her relationship with Gable, which&nbsp;poses something of a problem for the studio because Gable is technically still married&#x2014;and the last thing the film needs is more negative publicity. Julie is there to fend off the overly curious reporters, hoping to prevent details about the affair from slipping out. But she can barely keep up with her blond employer, let alone control what comes out of Carole&#x2019;s mouth, and&#x2014;as their friendship grows&#x2014;Julie soon finds she doesn&#x2019;t want to. Carole, both wise and funny, becomes Julie&#x2019;s model for breaking free of the past.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the ever-widening scope of this story, Julie is given a front-row seat to not one but two of the greatest love affairs of all time: the undeniable on-screen chemistry between Scarlett and Rhett, and offscreen, the deepening love between Carole and&nbsp;Clark. Yet beneath the shiny fa�ade, things in Hollywood are never quite what they seem, and Julie must&nbsp;learn to balance her career aspirations and her own budding romance with the outsized personalities and overheated drama on set. Vivid, romantic, and filled&nbsp;with Old Hollywood details, <i>A Touch of Stardust&nbsp;</i>will entrance, surprise, and delight.</p><p><p>KATE ALCOTT is the pseudonym for journalist Patricia O&#x2019;Brien, who has written several books, both fiction and nonfiction.

Her speech had its usual cynical&nbsp;tone, delivered with a roll of the eyes and a wry, impatient twist of the mouth&#x2014;not quite a smirk. It occurred to Julie that Doris sounded a little too much like the wisecracking, flip Rosalind Russell. Maybe it wasn&#x2019;t just coincidence. Lots of girls here were walking around emulating some star they wished they could be. Why not tough, sexy Doris? Thinking about it made her less intimidating, if not more likable.<br> Still, she was right. A roll of jittery chatter was threading through the huddled crowd of people on the edge of the Back Forty.<br> Selznick had invited everybody who worked at the studio to watch the &#x201c;festivities&#x201d; of the first day of shooting, a word that had produced a fair number of snickers among those who knew how fraught with problems this venture was. You could see it in the director George Cukor&#x2019;s rigid stance. He held himself immobile in the restless crowd, arms folded, a set expression on his face.<br> Julie scanned the crowd, trying to pick out the critics and journalists, several of whom looked enlivened by the prospect for disas-&nbsp;ter. It wasn&#x2019;t hard to recognize the columnist Hedda Hopper. She had the alert, bright-eyed face of a parrot as she darted here and there; her lips were heavy with bright-red lipstick; her eyes&#x2014;lined in black makeup that looked as permanent as cement&#x2014;missing nothing, peering out from under a flamboyantly feathered hat.<br> &#x201c;Look at her glare at Louella,&#x201d; Doris said, amused. &#x201c;Probably thinks she muscled herself in to get a better spot for watching the filming. She&#x2019;ll have something to say about&nbsp;<i>that&nbsp;</i>in tomorrow&#x2019;s column. Those two could kill each other.&#x201d;<br> Julie&#x2019;s gaze turned to Louella Parsons. By contrast, she looked like a proper matron heading for a proper afternoon tea. She was much shorter than Hedda, her plump body encased in something made of heavy, dark wool with glittering no-nonsense gold buttons the size of Ping-Pong balls. Her face was set on dignified affability, but her eyes looked like small rocks.<br> Julie knew this was the one to watch. Louella had hinted in her column today that the careers of several important people working on&nbsp;<i>Gone with the Wind&nbsp;</i>were about to be destroyed. It was a tantalizing, airy warning, meant to send shivers down the back of anyone who tried to withhold a scoop from her.<br> So that was in the buzz circulating through the crowd&#x2014;who was at risk?<br> And, Lord, there was the script.&nbsp;<i>Everyone&nbsp;</i>knew that was a disaster. Andy had said it was literally a mountain of paper with colored tabs marking the contributions of dozens of writers. The rumor going through the crowd was that Selznick was bringing in Ben Hecht for yet another rewrite. And what about the noises from the Screen Writers Guild? Were they really going to announce a strike?<br> And on it went. The less prominent reporters strained to hear it all, looking like fluttering crows as they hovered close to the cam- eras, trying to eavesdrop on Selznick&#x2019;s instructions to the crew.<br> Suddenly there was a furious shout.<br> &#x201c;Look, there&#x2019;s Gable,&#x201d; Rose whispered. &#x201c;What now?&#x201d;<br> An angry-looking Clark Gable, jacket flapping, came striding toward Selznick, ignoring everyone in his path. &#x201c;Those signs come<br> down&nbsp;<i>now,</i>&#x201d; he shouted.<br> &#x201c;What signs?&#x201d; Selznick said, obviously startled.<br> Gable pointed to a nearby knoll where a long line of portable toilets stood ready. The usual necessity for movies shot with hun- dreds of extras, they had been placed a distance from the cameras, winding down the knoll like dominoes in a row. They were painted a dull green, a color that discreetly blended into the landscape.<br> Except for the signs.<br> In large block letters, they declared their instructions on each toilet: white &nbsp;only, read the first one; negro only, read the second. And on down the line, the declaration instructions repeated in calm symmetry.<br> &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s the property manager?&#x201d; Gable demanded. &#x201c;David, I&#x2019;m off this movie if those signs don&#x2019;t come down.&#x201d;<br> Selznick stared&#x2014;and swore. He threw down the clipboard in his hands. A confused silence fell on the crowd.<br> &#x201c;Who the hell put those up?&#x201d; he yelled. His face was almost purple. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re not in the Deep South, we&#x2019;re in Culver City, California!&#x201d; The reporters were scribbling fast, and the photographers were scrambling to take pictures of the toilets. In the jostling for position, Hedda lost her hat and sputtered in outrage. The &#x201c;festivities&#x201d; had<br> taken an unexpected turn.<br> All Julie could think was, how could it be that no one had&nbsp;<i>noticed</i>? Cukor jumped into action. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know who authorized that,<br> but yank &#x2019;em down,&#x201d; he ordered a maintenance crewman. &#x201c;Right now, before one foot of film is shot.&#x201d; He cast a quick look at Gable. &#x201c;Thanks, Clark,&#x201d; he said.<br> Julie now saw a small cluster of extras dressed as slaves standing to the side. As she learned later, one of them had gone up to Gable&#x2019;s dressing room, knocked on the door, and asked him to intervene. This surely took courage.<br> &#x201c;They&#x2019;re no dumbbells,&#x201d; Doris chortled, nodding at the group. &#x201c;They know Selznick can&#x2019;t fire them and replace them with Mexicans&#x2014;not for this movie.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Okay, folks,&#x201d; shouted Selznick through a bullhorn. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got&nbsp;<i>that&nbsp;</i>stupidity corrected; now let&#x2019;s get on with making a movie.&#x201d; Julie craned to see Andy. She caught a glimpse of him staring&nbsp;at the scene as the signs were ripped down, a slight smile on his face. He saw her and gave a quick thumbs-up. Then he was back in conversation with the lighting crew, checking his clipboard, calling for the sound people. It was fun to watch him. He moved so easily, genially, talking to someone, scribbling a reply to a message, joking with the messenger, listening intently&#x2014;and making it all look so relaxed.<br> Gable stayed briefly in place, the fury on his face fading into a kind of vague puzzlement, as if he wondered where he was. He had made no secret that he would not hang around for filming&nbsp;<i>Gone with the Wind</i>&#x2019;s inaugural scene. Then, frowning, he turned on his heel and strode back to his dressing room.<br> &#x201c;Julie honey, David&#x2019;s got one reluctant Rhett Butler, and he&#x2019;ll stay away as much as he can,&#x201d; Carole had said with a sigh earlier that morning.<br> Selznick&#x2019;s shouted order &nbsp;accelerated everything. Cameramen were wheeling their cameras into place. Gaffers raced about check- ing electrical equipment; soundmen adjusted their instruments; sec- retaries were scribbling notes and running errands.<br> Julie went on tiptoe, peering at Tara. The first scene to be shot would be the opening one of the movie. Scarlett was to sit on the steps of her grand Southern home, flirting with two of her swains. She was to pout when they spoiled the mood by telling her that war was coming&#x2014;and they were enlisting.<br> Vivien Leigh, escorted by George Cukor, was already draping herself carefully on the steps of Tara. He held her hand, gently mov- ing her into position. She leaned her head back against a pillar, lis- tening to his soothing words, giving small, birdlike nods of assent. A makeup person armed with a soft powdered brush, intent on reduc- ing the shine from the lights on Vivien Leigh&#x2019;s face, dabbed at the actress&#x2019;s nose. A wardrobe assistant fussed over her flowered muslin gown, fluffing the rich folds of material and spreading them wide. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t breathe in this corset,&#x201d; Leigh complained loudly, but no one&nbsp;was paying attention.<br> Finally, all was ready.<br> &#x201c;Quiet on set!&#x201d; a production assistant bellowed. Looking quite solemn, he lifted a black-and-white clapperboard high. On it was scrawled in chalk:<br> <i>SCENE ONE, TAKE ONE&#x2014;GONE WITH THE WIND</i><br> He clapped the boards together, producing a sharp, commanding sound that brought immediate quiet.&nbsp;<i>Gone with the Wind&nbsp;</i>was about to be brought to life.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Up the gravel path, across the green lawn, the cameras travel to Tara. Scarlett sits framed beautifully &nbsp;on the graceful porch. Her voice is deli- ciously lilting and teasing as she begins flirting with the Tarleton twins, scolding them for their talk of war. Vivien Leigh&#x2014;with her boredom and corset complaints&#x2014;has disappeared. Scarlett O&#x2019;Hara is sitting there now.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> To Julie, all seemed perfect. To be drawn into this scene so quickly, in a way that was both the same as and yet different from when she burrowed into Margaret Mitchell&#x2019;s magical book, was enthralling. The colors, the clothes, the mood&#x2014;<br> &#x201c;Cut!&#x201d; Selznick barked.<br> Cukor glanced at Selznick in astonishment. His usual amiable smile vanished. A producer didn&#x2019;t issue orders on the set: that was the job and prerogative of the director. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;The scene was perfect.&#x201d;<br> Selznick shoved his hands into his pockets and strode up to the waiting actors, frowning. &#x201c;The dress isn&#x2019;t right,&#x201d; he said to Cukor, pulling one hand out of his pocket and flipping disdainfully at a sleeve of Scarlett&#x2019;s gorgeous gown. &#x201c;Call Wardrobe. I want her to wear pure white&#x2014;not the same damn dress she wears to the barbecue. That&#x2019;s not acceptable.&#x201d;<br> The crowd of workers and onlookers froze.<br> Cukor responded levelly, but the strain showed. &#x201c;David, that&#x2019;s wholly unnecessary,&#x201d; he said.<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, George. That&#x2019;s how I want it.&#x201d; It was Selznick&#x2019;s flat-as-stone voice, the one no one dared question.<br> &#x201c;You want to stop production for a&nbsp;<i>dress</i>?&#x201d; Cukor said incredulously.<br> &#x201c;Get Wardrobe on it,&#x201d; Selznick said, then walked away before<br> Cukor could respond. The director stood frozen.<br> &#x201c;So much for the celebratory first day of shooting,&#x201d; said Doris in a low voice. Even she couldn&#x2019;t manage her usual sardonic tone.<br> &#x201c;All the equipment, the people, everything,&#x201d; Julie said in surprise. &#x201c;Everybody packs up?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Everybody except Cukor. He&#x2019;s going to need some time to get his pride back. Selznick&#x2019;s making it pretty clear already what he&#x2019;s after.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;What&#x2019;s that?&#x201d;<br> Doris&#x2019;s eyes conveyed more than just a tinge of superiority. &#x201c;Julie, Cukor&#x2019;s the director, not Selznick. He&#x2019;s the one who usually makes calls like this one. Selznick is obviously ignoring him. Setting him up.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Setting him up for what?&#x201d;<br> Doris shrugged and turned to leave. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll see. Better hurry on back to Lombard&#x2019;s dressing room with news of Gable&#x2019;s defense of the working Negro. If she doesn&#x2019;t send you off to some zoo to rent an old lion, maybe you&#x2019;ll be able to pick up gossip for the rest of us. Something spicy.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Working for Lombard is better than the mimeograph room,&#x201d; Rose said loyally.<br> &#x201c;Oh, please.&nbsp;<i>Work?&nbsp;</i>For Lombard?&#x201d;<br> The two women watched Doris walk away, her long legs drawing glances from the men she passed.<br> &#x201c;Not a wrinkle in those silk stockings, and the seams are perfectly straight. I think we&#x2019;re entitled to hate her,&#x201d; Rose murmured.<br> Julie laughed, feeling better. &#x201c;Well, at least we don&#x2019;t have to worry about becoming friends with her,&#x201d; she said.<br> &nbsp;<br> *<br><br> Andy joined Julie briefly in the commissary at lunchtime. Gloomy, he chomped away on a turkey-and-cheese sandwich, barely speaking, to the point where she pushed back her coffee and started thinking about going back to answering Carole&#x2019;s mail. She was get- ting good at copying the actress&#x2019;s signature&#x2014;and if there were any mangy lions needed in the future, she would recommend Doris for the job.<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m meeting a friend for dinner tomorrow,&#x201d; he said abruptly. &#x201c;A novelist.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Anyone I would recognize?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Maybe. Scott Fitzgerald. He&#x2019;s working on the script.&#x201d; &#x201c;I thought Ben Hecht&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Yep, him, too. Everybody. Even though Sidney Howard did a great preliminary job.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve read&nbsp;<i>The Great Gatsby,</i>&#x201d; she said.<br> His face relaxed for a moment into a faint smile. &#x201c;I should&#x2019;ve known you&#x2019;d be a woman who actually reads. Pretty rare out here.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I can spell, too. Better than Fitzgerald.&#x201d;<br> He laughed this time. &#x201c;God, a college girl. I must be out of my mind.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Do you think he can help with the script?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;He&#x2019;s got some good ideas. Thinks we should use as much of Margaret Mitchell&#x2019;s dialogue as possible, but cut a lot of the redun- dant material. Selznick is resisting, naturally.&#x201d; Andy sighed. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what Scott&#x2019;s doing out here,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s got real talent, if he&#x2019;d control his drinking. He should be writing novels, far from Hollywood. No reason for him to sell out.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> *<br> &nbsp;<br> The next day&#x2019;s shoot went well, even though Julie heard that Scar- lett&#x2019;s hastily constructed white dress had to be held in place with clothespins at first and Miss Edith Head&#x2019;s seamstresses would sew it up in back between takes. Julie had hoped to watch, but at Carole&#x2019;s request, she worked that day from Carole&#x2019;s Bel-Air home on Cloud&nbsp;Road. Here she would have a respectable-sized &nbsp;office to handle publicity and secretarial work when Carole didn&#x2019;t need her on the Selznick lot. There was plenty to do, but Julie feared life would be far less exciting.<br> That was before a studio messenger showed up at the door at lunchtime with a package for Gable from David Selznick.<br> Julie accepted the package and held it out to Gable as he came in through the back door, his trousers muddied from working in the garden he and Carole were trying to nourish.<br> &#x201c;What the hell is this?&#x201d; he said, puzzled, when she handed him the package. &#x201c;Kind of heavy.&#x201d; Absently, he tossed a trowel he&#x2019;d been carrying onto a sleekly immaculate beige sofa. Julie picked it up quickly as he took the package into the dining room.<br> Silence at first. Then a barrage of curses, which brought Carole hurrying to his side.<br> &#x201c;Selznick is crazy,&#x201d; he sputtered, showing Carole the contents of the package. &#x201c;Ninety-two pages of instructions on how he wants me to play Rhett Butler. What kind of maniacal character&nbsp;<i>is&nbsp;</i>he?&#x201d;<br> He paced, looking worn. &#x201c;He doesn&#x2019;t trust me to play this stupid part,&#x201d; he said.<br> &#x201c;He&#x2019;s not the director&#x2014;&#x201d; began Carole.<br> &#x201c;Cukor? He&#x2019;s worse,&#x201d; Gable snapped. He began clawing through his pockets, pulled out a wrinkled cigarette pack, and rescued the last one. He crushed the empty pack into a ball and threw it at an ashtray. He missed.<br> Carole handed him a lighter, the silver one he had given her as a birthday gift.<br> &#x201c;He&#x2019;ll lavish attention on Vivien&#x2014;I can see that already,&#x201d; he said, inhaling deeply. &#x201c;Look, it&#x2019;s obvious. The man&#x2019;s a fag, and I don&#x2019;t like fags, and I&#x2019;m never going to like him. Selznick knows that.&#x201d;<br> He said the word so flatly. Of course, plenty of people felt the same way, but Julie couldn&#x2019;t help remembering this was the same man who spoke up for the Negro extras yesterday.<br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not going to pull out of the movie,&#x201d; Carole said quietly.<br><br> &#x201c;You haven&#x2019;t even done your first scene yet.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Presenting Scarlett with a fancy Paris hat,&#x201d; he scoffed. &#x201c;There are probably ten pages in this cra...</p></p><h2>Will Eisner&#39;s Shop Talk</h2><p>Awards: Will Eisner: Winner 2001 Harvey Award Best Graphic Album of Original Work for Last Day in Vietnam Will Eisner is a master of the comics medium, and when he got together to chat with other masters of the medium, what came of it was a collection of information vital to everyone working in the industry, and indispensable to anyone looking to get into it. Featuring interviews with Jack Kirby, Joe Simon, Gil Kane, Joe Kubert, Jack Davis, Neal Adams, C.C. Beck, Milton Caniff, Gill Fox, Harvey Kurtzman, and distribution guru Phil Seuling, Will Eisner&#39;s Shop Talk is chock full of golden tidbits of comics knowledge. Previously serialized in the now long out-of-print Spirit Magazine and Will Eisner&#39;s Quarterly, the interviews flow naturally into a compendium of technical secrets, light-hearted anecdotes, and informative history lessons.</p><p>New York native Will Eisner is universally acknowledged as one of the great masters of comic-book art. Born in 1917, he studied under anatomist George Bridgman and painter Robert Brachman before finding his true vocation as a cartoonist during the late 1930s. After a successful career as a packager of comic books for several publishers, Eisner concentrated his efforts on a weekly newspaper comic-book insert , The Spirit, which was syndicated worldwide for a dozen years and influenced a generation of young cartoonists. In 1952, Eisner devoted himself to the then-unique field of educational comics and produced P.S. Magazine, a monthly technical manual employing comics, which was published by the U.S. Army for over two decades. During the mid-1970s, Eisner returned to his first love: sequential art as a storytelling medium. In 1978 he wrote and drew the pioneering graphic novel A Contract With God. Since then, he has produced many other graphic novels, several of which have garnered awards both in the U.S. and abroad. Eisner&#39;s work for Dark Horse Comics includes the original graphic novel Last Day in Vietnam, and Shop Talk - a collection of Eisner&#39;s insightful interviews with his most celebrated peers in the comics industry. Eisner is now 84 years old and remains a prolific producer of great stories and phenomenal art.</p><h2>Machine Shop Essentials, Questions and Answers</h2><p>A comprehensive and detailed presentation of manual machine tools and methods, machine shop know-how and practical shop tips.

Right?</strong></p><p>Kenna is constantly surrounded by superheroes. Her best friend, her ex-boyfriend, practically everyone she knows has some talent or power. Kenna doesn't have a power. Sure, she's smart and independent, but surrounded by all the extraordinary, it's hard not feel very ordinary. And she's tired of it.</p><p>So when three villains break into the lab where she interns, Kenna refuses to be a victim. She stands her ground. She's not about to let criminals steal the research that will make her extraordinary too. </p><p>But in the heat of battle, secrets are spilled and one of the villains saves her life. Twice. Suddenly, everything Kenna thought she knew about good and evil, heroes and villains is upended. And to protect her life and those she loves, she must team up with her sworn enemies on a mission that will redefine what it means to be powerful and powerless...<br><br><strong>The Hero Agenda Series:</strong><br>Powerless (Book 1)<br>Relentless (Book 2)</p></p><p>Tera Lynn Childs is the RITA-award-winning and bestselling author of teen fiction about a mythological high school, mermaid princesses, monster-hunting triplet descendants of Medusa, and dark fae princes.<br><p><strong>Chapter 1</strong></p> <p>If I could have any superpower, right now, I'd choose the ability to reach through glass. One thin, little pane is all that separates me from bliss...of the midnight-snack variety, to be exact. The chocolate bar hangs halfway to freedom but refuses to take the plunge, as if the vending machine is mocking me, taunting me. </p> <p>As if it knows I'm powerless.</p> <p>Annoyed, I slam my palms against the glass. Everything inside shudders. My chocolate bar-pure Swiss milk chocolate dotted with toasted hazelnuts-doesn't budge.</p> <p>"Come on," I beg as if the candy can hear me. "Just a little farther."</p> <p>No such luck.</p> <p>Then again, when have I ever been lucky? I'm just glad no heroes are around to see me lose a battle with a vending machine. I would be the punch line to every joke for a year.</p> <p>Thankfully, the lab is pretty much empty at this time of night. Even Mom went home two hours ago, leaving me to transcribe the notes from today's sessions. I prefer to work when no one is around. My experiments fall into a gray area in the Superhero Code of Conduct, and even though I'm not technically a superhero-yet-I try not to piss off the powers-that-be. The last thing I need is to lose my lab privileges before I've perfected my formula.</p> <p>Copying down Mom's scribblings is like deciphering some previously unknown ancient language. It isn't exactly the most glamorous summer job ever, but it pays okay and gives me access to the facility.</p> <p>I'm almost done with tonight's transcription from the digital white board Mom and her team spent all day filling with chemical equations for her newest power-enhancing formula. Maybe twenty more minutes, and then I can get back to my test samples.</p> <p>My stomach rumbles in protest, reminding me that I skipped dinner. I really want that stupid chocolate bar. But since I just used my last quarters, my only hope is that one of the security guards upstairs has change for a ten.</p> <p>I turn away from the vending machine alcove and start back around the corner to grab my wallet from the lab.</p> <p>Right before I make the turn, I hear hurried footsteps. Not wanting a repeat of last week's collision with Dr. Harwood-my favorite jeans still smell like sulfur-I hang back a step.</p> <p>But the boy who rushes around the corner looks nothing like the balding, old scientist who works nearly as many late nights as I do.</p> <p>No, this guy is tall and lean, but not too skinny. He's got major biceps and I can see the outline of some pretty impressive muscles beneath his shirt. Yum. He's probably about my age or a little older, eighteen or nineteen maybe. And everything about him is shrouded in black-his tee and jeans, his heavy-duty boots, his shoulder-length hair-everything but his eyes.</p> <p>If we weren't in superhero central, I'd say he looks like a stereotypical villain.</p> <p>You'd think with all that darkness, he'd be nothing more than shadow. But he's all angles: his cheekbones, his jaw, even the collarbones I can see peeking out from the low neckline of his tee. Light seems to reflect off him like moon glow at midnight. Surrounded by all that sculpted darkness, his icy blue irises burn like the hottest flames.</p> <p>Our gazes collide, and though I know it's vain, I instantly wish my hair wasn't pulled back in a messy braid and that I was wearing something-anything-more appealing than my dad's ratty old 1996 Stanley Cup Champions tee.</p> <p>Hot guys in the underground lab are few and far between-Who am I kidding? Hot guys in my life are few and far between-so most of my wardrobe choices involve comfort and whether I mind if the garment gets ruined by acid, dye, or any of a million other compounds we work with every day.</p> <p>If my best friend, Rebel, were here, she'd be doing an I-told-you-so dance because she's been wanting to give me a makeover forever. That, and she'd already have his number and email address, and they'd be making plans for their date this weekend. Me, I can't even manage a simple "hello."</p> <p>The fact that he's scowling at me, those dark brows slashing low over those bright eyes, isn't helping anything.</p> <p>"The lab is supposed to be empty," he says.</p> <p>His voice is flat, but his comment almost feels like an accusation.</p> <p>"I'm working late," I answer, trying not to sound defensive. "What are you doing here?"</p> <p>He lifts an eyebrow. "You're working in the hall?"</p> <p>"I needed a break to come get chocolate," I say, gesturing at the vending machine behind me.</p> <p>He nods down at my empty hands. "You don't have any chocolate."</p> <p>"That thing hates me. Took my money and kept the candy bar."</p> <p>In a graceful movement that looks almost choreographed, Dark-and-Scowly steps around me and up to the greedy machine. He presses his palms to the glass, just like I did. Hey, maybe he has the power to reach through glass. After all, around here pretty much everyone but me has some kind of super ability.</p> <p>When his hands don't immediately sink through the surface, I say, "I tried smacking it already. Didn't work."</p> <p>Moving his hands closer to the edge, he curls his fingers around the frame. Then, with his boots braced on the floor, he gives the whole machine a solid shove. The heavy hunk of metal rocks back once, then comes forward, its front legs hitting the tile floor with a sharp thud. On impact, the chocolate bar sails against the glass before falling into the trough below.</p> <p>He turns to face me, a cocky smile twisting one side of his mouth. "Takes a special touch."</p> <p>I duck down and reach through the hinged door to grab the candy bar.</p> <p>"You're my hero," I joke.</p> <p>He snorts. "Right."</p> <p>I stand up, chocolate clutched safely in my hand. There's an awkward silence that stretches into uncomfortable territory. When I can't take it anymore, I wag the candy and say, "Well, thanks."</p> <p>I start to walk around him, to head back to the lab, when he steps into my path.</p> <p>"So, what boring work do you have to take breaks from?"</p> <p>I try to sound casual, like I'm not eager to keep talking to him. "I'm transcribing notes in the manipulation lab."</p> <p>As I point down the same hall he came from, he turns his head to follow the direction of my gesture. I automatically check for the mark of the League beneath his right ear. If it's there, I can't see it behind his hair. He could be a hero. Or he could be an ordinary, just like me.</p> <p>Suddenly self-conscious, I tug a piece of hair forward to cover my unmarked skin.</p> <p>When he looks at me again, his scowl is back in place and even deeper.</p> <p>He asks, "You're working in Dr. Swift's lab?"</p> <p>"She's my mom. I'm helping her out." I shrug. "There are worse summer jobs."</p> <p>He gaze skims over me. "You're Kenna Swift?"</p> <p>And that's the end of that.</p> <p>My mom is famous in hero circles. She's developed more than a dozen different formulas for the superhero world, from sprays that thaw victims of freeze rays to supplements that keep thought-readers out of someone's mind. She's earned the League Medal of Valor three times. And those were just for the inventions they know about. She's their very own Einstein, Edison, and Jobs rolled into one.</p> <p>The only thing I'm famous for is being the powerless daughter of a superhero. My dad was one of the best of the best. And I'm...nothing.</p> <p>I shift my weight, wanting to redirect the conversation away from me. "You never answered my question. What are you doing down here so late?"</p> <p>Those bright blue eyes sear into me as he takes a step back. "I have to go."</p> <p>His sudden evasiveness makes me suspicious, so when he starts to move past me, I sidestep into his path. "Excuse me," I say, "but this is a secure level. Are you even authorized to be down here?"</p> <p>"My dad," he says, scowling at me. "He's a security guard."</p> <p>A security guard? The facility might be so big that I can't keep track of everyone who works in every lab, but I know all the guards by name. Especially the night guards, since I'm usually the last one here.</p> <p>Travis and Luther are on duty tonight. Travis and his wife just had their first baby, a girl named Tia. Luther is old enough to be my great-grandfather and he never married.</p> <p>I take half a step back as my suspicions turn to concern. "Who's your dad?" I demand.</p> <p>This guy definitely has the look of a villain.</p> <p>What if he really is one?</p> <p>He glances nervously over his shoulder. "He's-"</p> <p>I shake my head and start to walk away before he can finish the lie.</p> <p>He reaches for me, but I shrug him off. My heart is beating way too fast. This could go way bad, way quick.</p> <p>"Please, just listen." He waits until I'm looking him in the eye before he continues. "You know me," he says, his voice taking on this weird, hypnotic tone. "We've met before."</p> <p>His eyes start to burn brighter and brighter. Oh crap. He must be a villain, and one with a psy power. The vilest kind. Fear and anger collide inside me as I wonder what to do about him trying to mess with my head. How to play this? I can't exactly tell him I'm-</p> <p>Suddenly, the floor beneath my feet shudders violently, knocking me off balance. I lurch forward into Dark-and-Scowly's arms. He catches me, grabs my upper arms, just as a concussion wave of air and sound hits us.</p> <p>That sounded-and felt-like a bomb went off in the lab. If we weren't a hundred feet underground and shielded by every protection science and superheroes can create, I'd think the supervillain Quake had struck. But that's impossible.</p> <p>Then again, impossible doesn't always apply in the superhero world. After all, impossible didn't keep Dark-and-Scowly from being where he doesn't belong.</p> <p>Suddenly, every alarm in the facility blares. I freak. The lab! All that research-Mom's and mine-is priceless. The superhero blood samples alone are more valuable than anything else in the building.</p> <p>Panic overrides judgment and I push away, but his grip only tightens. The jerk. A little super strength would be really useful right now.</p> <p>"You can't go in there."</p> <p>"Who are you?" I demand, struggling to get out of his grasp. If he really is a villain, I don't want him near me or this lab. Not with what villains are capable of. "What have you done?"</p> <p>He doesn't answer. More pissed than ever, I fake left and pull right. He follows my fake-out, and as his hair swings with the momentum, I see the mark I'd been looking for earlier. Not under his right ear like the superheroes. Under his left.</p> <p>Shit.</p> <p>"You're a villain." It's not a question. I struggle harder. "What did you do? Let me go!"</p> <p>"Don't!" he shouts above the roaring sirens. "If you go in there, you could get hurt. They're upset-"</p> <p>I might not have superpowers, but I know how to knee a guy in the nuts. Before he can finish his sentence, he's doubled over, gasping for breath. I dash for the corner, but I don't get two steps before his hand clamps around my elbow.</p> <p>"No, Kenna, you can't!" he shouts. "Trust me. If you-"</p> <p>Anger overwhelms me. I've spent my whole life running from villains-from what they've done to my family. From what they might do to me. And I'm sick of it. I'm fed up with the whole steer-clear-of-anything-remotely-dangerous thing my mom's had me doing for so long.</p> <p>Just because I don't have a power doesn't mean I'm powerless.</p> <p>I turn on him with a furious growl and, using the karate-chop technique Rebel taught me, land a solid hit to the side of his neck. He releases me and I wrench open the door to the janitor's closet, use my entire body weight to shove him inside, then slam the door in his stunned face.</p> <p>Holding the door handle with one hand, I use my other to dig out my security badge. I run it over the reader pad until I hear the lock engage. I leave him pounding against the door.</p> <p>Who's the helpless ordinary now?</p> <p>I sprint down the hall and around the corner to find the area outside the lab full of smoke. I hold my arm up to my face, covering my mouth with my sleeve as I look around.</p> <p>The windows that line the wall between the lab and the hall have shattered, covering the floor with a million shards of safety glass. No ordinary bomb could have done that. Whoever that v-bag in the closet is, he obviously has help. There's another villain here. One with some kind of explosive power.</p> <p>For a moment, fear paralyzes me. A villain like that killed my father, used his evil power to blow Dad up right in front of me. That same villain would have killed me if the heroes hadn't come along and stopped him. I was only four, but I remember watching my dad die. One moment he was yelling for me to run. And the next he was gone, nothing more than scorch marks on the tile.</p> <p>Rage rips through me at the memory, burning away the last of my fear and sending me careening straight toward the lab. Villains have already taken my father from me. No way are they getting their disgusting paws on my mother's lab-and my research-too. Between the smoke and the strobe lights from the fire alarms, the lab looks like a better-lit version of the club Rebel always wants to go to. Or a designated disaster area.</p> <p>Through the haze, I pull open the door. I know every inch of the lab by heart. Even smoke-blind, I can find my way to the emergency ventilation button.</p> <p>Weaving around stools and counters, I hurry along the front edge of the room. Seconds later my stomach connects with the counter that lines the far wall. I lean forward, tracing my fingers up the tile until I feel the big, red button.</p> <p>I smack my palm against the plastic. A whooshing sound fills the lab, so powerful it almost drowns out the alarm sirens. Faster than I expect, smoke gets sucked up and out of the room through the massive vent in the middle of the ceiling. As the haze dissipates, the shadow of a figure emerges. A man stands in the back corner of the lab, facing the vault.</p> <p>And the door is wide open.</p> <p>I'm too late. I've failed.</p> <p>"No," I whisper, terrified at what the villains might get their hands on.</p> <p>I have to find a way to warn the League. Right now. The system automatically sends alerts, but there have been a number of false alarms lately. I don't want them to dismiss this as another one.</p> <p>I glance around wildly and see my cell phone charging on the other side of the lab.</p> <p>Using the counter to push off, I launch myself into a sprint. Only I don't take into account the stool I had pulled into the center of the room while working on the transcription earlier. I crash into it and send myself stumbling into the nearest lab table.</p> <p>"What have we here?" a sneering voice asks with a crisp British accent.</p> <p>I turn to the guy standing in front of the vault. Like Dark-and-Scowly, he's dressed in all black. Must be the standard-issue villain uniform these days. Except that his shock of red hair-which is currently standing on end-and the look of surprise on his face make him seem more startled-matchstick than villain-capable-of-blowing-up-the-vault.</p> <p>That is, until he narrows his eyes at Dark-and-Scowly, who has somehow appeared in the blown-out doorway. I have a moment to wonder how the hell he got out of the janitor's closet before Matchstick hisses, "I thought you were supposed...</p></p><h2>Hellblazer: Shoot TP (John Constantine, Hellblazer)</h2><p>An assortment of Hellblazer stories written by Brian Azzarello (100 BULLETS), Warren Ellis (PLANETARY), and others.

Even with a lightweight, white tank top on, the early morning sun beat down hot rays on her scalp, face, and shoulders. She squinted toward the beach and lifted her dread locks up higher in a ponytail scrunchie, searching for Carlos, then let out a hard breath of frustration when she didn&#x2019;t immediately spot him.</p><p>Why did everything on the team always have to be done by committee? Okay, sure, every man in the house whose wife was pregnant was freaking out, and the Berkfields were having a fit because their daughter, Krissy, and daughter-in-law, Jasmine, were carrying their first grandchildren, but she and Carlos couldn&#x2019;t just do an energy fold-away this close to the Bermuda Triangle! Basic quantum physics made that impossible. The Triangle was magnetically unstable. J.L. knew that. Every tactical Guardian on the team should have been able to grasp the implications. Why they had to argue that fact with the team was beyond her.</p><p>It was simple, at least in her mind. Deviations in the magnetic field around the phenomenon were caused by micro-worm holes, otherwise known as transit-tunnels&#x2014;the same tunnel system that the team seemed to have forgotten that Cain used to lead a full aqua-demon army out of Nod before. </p><p>Damali blew a stray strand of damp hair up off her forehead, exasperated. The damned Bermuda Triangle, just like all the other vortexes on the planet, was filled with rips in the cosmic fabric, some only a giga-fraction of an inch&#x2014;a tear so small that it could be represented by the number one proceeded by something crazy like thirty-three zeros, where unstable mini-black holes of virtual matter and mini-white holes of virtual anti-matter fluxed on a dime in and out of the geometry of space. </p><p>Only Cain was insane enough, and driven enough, to risk bringing his armies through a temporary black hole flux... just like the angels must have jettisoned the team through a quick flicker of white hole opening to get them here. But neither she nor Carlos was down for chancing that. Hell no&#x2014;that&#x2019;d be like trying to jump into a millisecond turning double-Dutch rope that was changing from black-white-black-white and hoping they could snatch the entire team through on white. <em>Not</em>.</p><p>Pulling a team through that, where one burp in the inter-dimensional vortex could land then God only knew where was not an option. No wonder Carlos was freaking out.</p><p>After a moment of walking to calm down, Damali steadied herself. The team was panicked, and her gut told her that was why unity was so hard to achieve right now. Everybody had to chill. Marj and Berkfield had their parental worries about Krissy and Bobby, as well as their kids&#x2019; spouses and unborn grands... just like Marlene and Shabazz were no doubt scared to death for her and Carlos. Maybe Yonnie and Val, along with Rider and Tara would be the balancers of sanity this time out, she prayed. Inez and Mike were too freaked out about the whereabouts of little Ayana and Mom Delores, rightfully so, to be of much help. But Bobby, J.L., Jose, and Dan would probably have a cow once they finally learned she was pregnant, too... which was why she knew Carlos needed to go take a long walk before he&#x2019;d said something about her state that had been forbidden by the Neteru joint Kings&#x2019; and Queens&#x2019; Councils. Why was everything always so hard?</p><p>She&#x2019;d left the team to its collective squabbling about the potential next steps to take without looking back. They&#x2019;d still be at it by the time she got back, she was sure. This was the part of communal living that Carlos couldn&#x2019;t stand; she knew her husband well. After the team meeting, that Scorpio was going to need a private, quiet place to get his head together. Fury waves had been coming off his body so intensely that they were threatening to either fuse the Turkish rug to the hardwood floors around him or start a blaze. That&#x2019;s when he simply got up and left the villa.</p><p>Yeah, Carlos had to get up, get out, and walk it off. It was easy to understand. The dark side had jacked with Carlos Rivera&#x2019;s cash flow, which represented <em>major</em> disrespect where he came from, and she knew his old street ways were wrestling within him. That part of him would never fully die. It would always resonate in his being, no matter what. Once from the streets always from the streets. Mess with a brother&#x2019;s money? Oh hell to the no. Damali just shook her head as she searched the beach for him. Some things were simply embedded in the man&#x2019;s DNA. </p><p>Armageddon notwithstanding, with a wife and a baby on the way, the dark side was playing to all of her husband&#x2019;s deepest fears&#x2014;all of which centered on basic survival. For Carlos, she knew cash meant flexibility, maneuverability, strength, a back door escape. If he was liquid, he could flow like the water sign he was and get out of whatever. But they&#x2019;d taken that option away and Senor Rivera wasn&#x2019;t having it.</p><p>By the time she found him, heat had radiated off his aura so hot that it had turned the sand around him to glass. Actual grains of sand had fused together right under him without burning him and then quickly cooled from the Trade Winds and surf. It was eerie to see him sitting all alone, yogi style wearing jeans and a red t-shirt, hovering several inches above the beach in heavy meditation, aura glowing white hot silver and him taking in long, deep breaths, practically shaking with rage. A deep crimson V of sweat marked his shirt as his broad shoulders and back slowly expanded and contracted beneath it.</p><p>Stopping for a moment, she wrestled with the decision about how best to approach him. He needed to know that she was on his side, even if she didn&#x2019;t agree with the waste of energy being expended on rage. They had shit to do and had to do it quickly before Mr. Fontaine at the resort began to inquire further.</p><p>Caribbean sun beat down on Carlos&#x2019;s bronze skin making the silver aura around him shimmer until she had to partially shield her eyes with her hand. Small beads of silver perspiration cast a glow to his dam</p></p><h2>Bump in the Night (The Flaxborough Chronicles)</h2><p>Inspector Purbright is called in when the fourth explosion in Chalmsbury ends in death in this second entry in the Flaxborough Chronicles.

In other words, a Cape Cod house. From the mid-1600s to about 1850, Capes were built all across New England, homes to fishermen and farmers, to city dwellers and shipwrights. Their low-slung design meant they were economical, easy to build, and generally impervious to the bracing winds that swept in from the ocean. They could be enlarged by equally symmetrical wings, and if you couldn't afford clapboards all around, you could easily sheath the back and sides with inexpensive cedar shingles and let them weather to a stormy gray.<br><br>In short, these were the structures that worked their way into our native psyche and hearts.

Miss Warner, forty-four and famous for her novel Lolly Willowes, had recently begun writing stories for the magazine, antic, inimitable sketches of English life that Maxwell adored. The poems were sent, and a remarkable friendship was begun.</p><p>Michael Steinman is the editor The Happiness of Getting it Down Right: Letters of William Maxwell and Frank O&#39;Connor. He lives in Melville, New York.In 1936, the English writer Sylvia Townsend Warner published her first story in the New Yorker; shortly thereafter she was contacted by mail by a new entry-level editor named William Maxwell. Over the next 40 years, Warner published 153 stories in the magazine, and Maxwell became one of the best-known fiction arbiters of his time. They came to be close friends and correspondents, their exchange (totaling 1,300 letters) depending only partially on New Yorker business. The two carried on an almost impossibly civilized conversation: Warner, learned and eccentric, peppered her letters with obscure literary references and enclosed the odd gift (one year she sent Maxwell a spoon). Maxwell displayed an editor's refinement and a touching solicitude toward his British friend. Though at times they foundered in a sea of mutual admiration, the correspondents were at their best when exchanging literary opinions, details of their respective family lives or simply two ordinary people's distracted awareness of global events. The letters were often not dated, and putting them in sequence must have been a Herculean task for editor Steinman (who also edited Maxwell's correspondence with Frank O'Connor); in any case, the edition is not without flaws. Unable to print the entire correspondence because of its sheer volume, Steinman included some complete letters and excerpts of others, without noting his omissions or explaining his choices; there is no framing material other than a brief introduction, and scarcely any notes contextualizing the letters. Yet despite these editorial oversights, readers who admire Warner and Maxwell for their own beautifully expressed selves will find much to enjoy in this tribute to the leisurely intimacies of a bygone era. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>The Knitting Stitch Handbook: Over 250 Traditional and Contemporary Stitches with Easy-to-Follow Charts</h2><p><b><i>The Knitting Stitch Handbook&nbsp;</i>is a comprehensive gallery of more than 250 stitches, ranging from the easiest purl stitch to the most complex intarsia pattern. </b><br><br> Yarns, needles, ball bands, and and other equipment are explained in detail, with guided instructions on purchasing.

Novelistic, meditative, offbeat, and soulful, Cathy Park Hong's poetry is many fathoms deep." &#x2015;David Mitchell</strong></p><p><em>Engine Empire</em> is a trilogy of lyric and narrative poems that evoke an array of genres and voices, from Western ballads to sonnets about industrialized China to fragmented lyric poems set in the future. Through three distinct yet interconnected sequences, Cathy Park Hong explores the collective consciousness of fictionalized boomtowns in order to explore the myth of prosperity. The first sequence, called "Ballad of Our Jim," draws inspiration from the Old West and follows a band of outlaw fortune seekers who travel to a California mining town during the 1800s. In the second sequence, "Shangdu, My Artful Boomtown!" a fictional industrialized boomtown draws its inspiration from present-day Shenzhen, China. The third and last section, "The World Cloud," is set in the far future and tracks how individual consciousness breaks up when everything&#x2015;books, our private memories&#x2015;becomes immediately accessible data. One of our most startlingly original poets, Hong draws together individual voices at odds with the world, voices that sing their wonder and terror.</p></p><p>Cathy Park Hong is the author of Translating Mo&#x2019;um and Dance Dance Revolution and has won a Pushcart Prize and the Barnard Women Poets Prize.

Lowering her head, she put all her weight into her forequarters and plowed up the mountainside. With each powerful step, dirt and small rocks exploded from beneath her hooves, tumbling downward like a miniature landslide.<br><br>Gabriel Dempsey rode the mare hard to the top of the rise. Once there, they stopped to rest, both of them breathing hard, their legs trembling. Despite her exertion, the mare would keep going if he asked. She wasn't just young and strong. The blood from generations of wild mustangs ran in her veins, infusing her with a spirit and unbreakable will unmatched by any other breed of horse.<br><br>No, it was Gabe who couldn't go on. He was spent. Utterly and completely exhausted. Not from the trail ride, but from the emotional events of the past four days.<br><br>Exactly seventeen months and twenty-three days after the doctor's initial prognosis, cancer had taken his father's life.<br><br>Today, the family had memorialized him in a service that had brought out half the town of Mustang Valley, along with a hundred other mourners from all over Arizona. Tomorrow Gabe and his family would spread August Dempsey's ashes in the flower garden behind the house.<br><br>His father would spend eternity where he, Gabe's grandfather and great-grandfather had lived and toiled their entire lives, on the three-thousand-acre Dos Estrellas Ranch.<br><br>Shading his eyes against the glaring afternoon sun, Gabe stared at the ranch nestled in the valley below. From this distance, the house, barns and outbuildings appeared deceptively small, like a painting hanging on a wall. Adding to the illusion were horses in the back pastures and sixteen hundred head of cattle dotting the extensive grazing lands beyond the pastures.<br><br>Grief suddenly gripped Gabe's chest like a giant metal vise, colder than the November wind ripping across the rise from the slopes of the nearby McDowell Mountains.<br><br>He sat straight in the saddle, refusing to succumb to emotion or show the slightest sign of weakness. Even out here, where there wasn't another living soul for two miles in any direction. The battle facing him at home promised to be a difficult one. This was only the beginning.<br><br>Among all the mourners gathered at the ranch to pay their final respects to one of Mustang Valley's greatest citizens were two strangers. Gabe's half brothers. August Dempsey's <em>legitimate</em> sons. Rumor had it, they'd come to claim their share of the Dos Estrellas Ranch, left to them by the father they barely knew. Gabe would know for sure tomorrow afternoon at the reading of the will.<br><br>If they did inherit, he intended to fight them tooth and nail, regardless if he had a legal right to the ranch or not. He was the son who'd worked side by side with their father for over two decades. The son who was proud of his heritage and treasured it. Who loved the ranch with the same fervor and devotion as any Dempsey before him. He hadn't left as a kid and never returned.<br><br>Giving the mare a nudge, Gabe followed the narrow deer trail south as it alternately dipped, climbed and snaked. Not far below him, a line of barbed wire fencing ran parallel to the trail.<br><br>The fence separated Dos Estrellas from its nearest neighbor and longtime cattle-ranching rival, the Small Change, though <em>small</em> was a misnomer. The ranch was twice the size of Dos Estrellas and these days, owner Theo McGraw ran close to thirty-five hundred head of fat, sassy cattle.<br><br>Cancer was a greedy disease and had taken more than Gabe's father. Astronomical medical bills continued to pour in daily, many of which weren't covered by health insurance. With no choice, Gabe and his mother had sold off what they could, depleting Dos Estrellas's resources. It wasn't enough, and the wolves continued to prowl outside their door. Gabe and his half brothers might well wind up fighting over a pile of scraps.<br><br>The trail abruptly veered west. Gabe and the mare dropped down into the mouth of a ravine thick with creosote, sage and cacti. Last month's heavy rains had resulted in abundant desert foliage that had survived the recent cold snap and remained a vibrant green.<br><br>At the bottom of the ravine, the mare halted. Lifting her head, she smelled the air, her ears pricked forward.<br><br>"What do you see, Bonita?"<br><br>Gabe had been raised around horses and trusted their instincts, especially those of a mustang born in the wild. Something was amiss.<br><br>He sat still and listened, his eyes scanning the uneven horizon. Coyotes and bobcats regularly traveled this ravine, along with the occasional mountain lion. None were an immediate threat. Desert predators usually avoided humans. The mare's survival instincts, however, were powerful, and she might attempt to flee.<br><br>She didn't, which Gabe found interesting. Whatever lurked in the bush clearly wasn't a predator. What, then&#x2014;<br><br>A sharp, shrill screech pierced the air followed by a faint cry of distress. Pausing long enough to choose the best course, he set off in the direction of the sounds, taking the steep trail at a brisk trot, the fastest he dare go without endangering himself or Bonita.<br><br>At the top of the rise, his heart stopped cold. The entire back half of a horse was submerged in a sinkhole, nearly up to the saddle horn. The horse's head and front legs stuck out of the narrow opening at a painful and impossible angle, almost as if he were standing up. Covered with mud and wide-eyed with fright, the horse flailed helplessly.<br><br>On the ground in front of the horse, beyond the reach of the sinkhole, a woman attempted to free him by jerking on the reins and calling out encouragements. Both woman and horse were clearly done in from the struggle. Without help, the horse would eventually die. Every moment counted.<br><br>Gabe dug his boot heels into Bonita's sides. The mare didn't hesitate and carried them down the steep slope. More than once she nearly lost her footing, slipping and sliding over the rocky terrain. At the bottom, Gabe tugged hard on the reins, slowing Bonita and bringing her under control.<br><br>"Are you okay?" he called to the woman, covering the remaining distance at a lope.<br><br>"I need help." She spared him the briefest of glances, paused for a fraction of a second, then went right back to pulling on the reins.<br><br>Gabe's brain registered two things simultaneously. First, there was no way in hell she was ever going to save that horse by herself. Maybe no one could. Second, he'd seen the woman a mere four hours earlier at the funeral. She'd sat in the rear pew of the crowded church next to her father, Theo McGraw, Gabe's father's rival.<br><br>"Hang on." Gabe jumped off Bonita and, leading the mare, approached Reese McGraw. "Got yourself in a fix here."<br><br>"I missed the hole. It was covered with twigs and dead leaves."<br><br>Sinkholes weren't uncommon in the desert, especially after heavy rains, though they were generally larger. This particular hazard was deceptively small, measuring three and a half feet at its widest point, and easy to miss.<br><br>"It happens," he said matter-of-factly.<br><br>"Can you help me get him out?"<br><br>"I'll try."<br><br>She swallowed, and Gabe noticed the dried streaks on her cheeks. Had she been crying or was the cold wind responsible for her tears?<br><br>"Are you hurt?"<br><br>"No." She shook her head, and a hank of shoulder-length strawberry blond hair loosened from its clip. As if sensing his gaze, she said, "I lost my hat when I bailed off."<br><br>"We'll find it later." The hat didn't matter. He was simply trying to calm her. She'd need all her strength for the ordeal ahead, along with her concentration.<br><br>She continued tugging on the reins, which the confused horse fought, jerking his big head to the side rather than using the added momentum to hoist himself out of the hole.<br><br>"Take it easy," Gabe said.<br><br>"I can't. If I do, he'll sink deeper."<br><br>"No, he won't. Trust me." Gabe put up a restraining hand. "Hold steady, but don't pull. Not yet. Wait until I tell you to."<br><br>"What are you going to do?" Worry filled her eyes.<br><br>Gabe hadn't noticed their vibrant green color before. Then again, he generally avoided Reese. "Well, if we can't drag him out, I'll ride for help."<br><br>Neither of them voiced aloud what they were doubtless thinking; there may not be time for that. Who knew the depth of the hole? One wrong move, and the horse's own weight could drag him under the mud.<br><br>Gabe decided he'd seen enough death for one week. If it was at all humanly possible, he would save this horse.<br><br>"Focus on keeping his head up," he told Reese.<br><br>Gabe lined up Bonita next to her. The mare obediently stood quiet. Next, he removed the coil of rope from his saddlebag and fastened one end to a metal ring on the right side of his saddle. Letting out rope a foot at a time, he neared the panicked horse.<br><br>"Easy now, partner," he cooed. "That's right."<br><br>Sides heaving and nostrils flaring, the big paint stared at Gabe. Perhaps his imagination was working overtime, but he swore the horse understood he was trying to help.<br><br>He continued talking to the paint as he pondered how best to fasten the rope. Simply around the head wouldn't provide enough leverage. They'd strangle the horse before they rescued him. No way could he feed the rope beneath the horse's chest and behind his front legs, which would be ideal. He'd likely injure his hand in the process.<br><br>Gabe decided to run the rope through the girth on either side of the saddle. A tricky operation. One miscalculation and the results could end in disaster. For the horse and Gabe.<br><br>"Here goes nothing."<br><br>Thankfully, the horse remained quiet while Gabe circled him and attached the rope to both sides, looping it behind the saddle horn for added resistance. It was the best he could do under the circumstances. By the time he finished, sweat had gathered on his forehead and soaked the inside of his shirt.<br><br>He removed his cowboy hat and combed his fingers through his damp hair.<br><br>"You holding up?" he asked Reese.<br><br>"I'm fine."<br><br>Right. She looked ready to drop. He gave her credit, though. She wasn't a quitter.<br><br>"Then, let's get this horse out."<br><br>He patted Bonita's rump. She'd done well so far. What came next would be the real test.<br><br>Glancing over his shoulder, he inspected his handiwork one last time. The big paint cooperated by not moving. That, or he was past the point of fighting.<br><br>Gabe stood at Bonita's head and gripped the side of her bridle above the bit. The rope stretched taut from both sides of her saddle to both sides of the paint's.<br><br>"Good girl." He rubbed her soft nose. "You can do it."<br><br>Bonita nuzzled his hands, not the least bit concerned.<br><br>He peered over her back at Reese. "You ready?"<br><br>"Yes." She didn't look it. Her hands shook and her face was alarmingly pale.<br><br>"Your job is to keep that horse's head up. Bonita and I will do the rest. You understand?"<br><br>"Got it."<br><br>"Any sign of trouble, you let go. I mean it. Don't put any of us in danger." She nodded.<br><br>"All right then. On the count of three. One, two, three." He clucked to Bonita and yanked on her bridle.<br><br>Muscles straining, hide quivering, the mare took one step forward, then a second.<br><br>Gabe glanced back at the paint. He'd yet to move, other than stretching his head and neck out as far as they would go.<br><br>"Come on, boy. Now or never."<br><br>They could only do so much. It was entirely up to the horse. If he didn't haul himself out of the sinkhole and onto solid ground, he would die right where he was.<br><br>Bonita didn't quit and, once again, Gabe admired the little mare he'd handpicked from his friend Cara's herd of rehabilitated wild mustangs.<br><br>"He's doing it!" Reese hollered.<br><br>Gabe looked. True enough, the horse had found the will to save itself. With tremendous effort, he dug his front hooves into the ground and, with the aid of the primitive pulley, climbed out of the deep mud.<br><br>"Don't quit on us now." Gabe wasn't sure who he was talking to. The horse or Bonita or Reese. Did it really matter?<br><br>With a final mighty groan, the horse heaved himself out, landing with a grunt on his belly. Gabe let go of Bonita and rushed to the paint, afraid the unsteady horse would slide back into the hole.<br><br>One rope in each hand, he pulled with every ounce of his strength. It wasn't enough.<br><br>"Help me," he said to Reese.<br><br>In a flash, she was there.<br><br>"Grab the saddle."<br><br>She did, and by some miracle, they dragged the horse two feet before they gave out. The ground beneath the heavy horse held. He lay there, his back legs suspended over the hole and dripping mud, his breathing coming in great gusts.<br><br>"Give him a few minutes," Gabe said, flexing his cramped and aching fingers. "Then we'll get him up."<br><br>"Okay." Reese stood bent at the waist, her hands braced on her knees.<br><br>Gabe, too, rested. How long had this taken? Thirty minutes? An hour? He wasn't sure. Except that, for whatever time it took, he hadn't once thought of his father's death.<br><br>"My God, Gabe, you did it! You saved him."<br><br>The next instant, Reese slammed into him, her arms circling his neck. He automatically steadied them both by holding on to her.<br><br>"Thank you," she said, clinging to him, her face buried in his coat.<br><br>He stared at the top of her head, momentarily stunned. He'd touched Reese just one other time in their entire lives. They'd been in high school, at their senior prom. He'd cradled her while she cried and begged him not to tell anyone she was pregnant.</p><h2>Killer: My Life in Hockey</h2><p><p><strong>The #1 Bestselling&nbsp;Canadian Non-Fiction Book of the Year</strong></p><p>They called him Killer.</p><p>Doug Gilmour didn&#x2019;t look fearsome on a pair of skates&#x2014;being an &#x201c;undersized&#x201d; forward would plague him during his early career&#x2014;but few players matched his killer instincts in the faceoff circle or in front of the net.

In the north, the tribes are increasingly bold in their raids on the Imperium. Ballista must undertake his most treacherous journey yet. He must face the Heruli -- the Eaters of Flesh, the Wolves of the North -- the most brutal tribe of them all, and try to turn them against one another. As Ballista and his retinue make their journey, someone -- or something -- is hunting them, picking them off one by one, and leaving a trail of mutilated corpses and terror. Ballista is in a strange land, among strange people, but is it possible that the greatest threat may come from within his own circle? Renowned for their skilled blending of action and historical accuracy, Sidebottom&#39;s Warrior of Rome novels take the reader from the shouts of the battlefield to the whisperings of the emperor&#39;s inner circle. Rich in detail and punctuated by harrowing action, there&#39;s no better way to transport yourself back to the days of the Roman Empire.</p><p><b>Harry Sidebottom</b> teaches classical history at Oxford, where he is a Fellow of St. Benet&#x2019;s Hall and a lecturer at Lincoln College.

Bennett Cerf and Donald Klopfer, the company's founders, had acquired the Modern Library from publishers Boni and Liveright two years earlier. One day, their friend the illustrator Rockwell Kent stopped by their office. Cerf later recalled, "Rockwell was sitting at my desk facing Donald, and we were talking about doing a few books on the side, when suddenly I got an inspiration and said, 'I've got the name for our publishing house. We just said we were go-ing to publish a few books on the side at random. Let's call it Random House.' Donald liked the idea, and Rockwell Kent said, 'That's a great name. I'll draw your trademark.' So, sitting at my desk, he took a piece of paper and in five minutes drew Random House, which has been our colophon ever since." Throughout the years, the mission of Random House has remained consistent: to publish books of the highest quality, at random. We are proud to continue this tradition today.<br><br>This edition is set from the first American edition of 1937 and commemorates the seventy-fifth anniversary of Random House.</p><h2>Midnight Harvest</h2><p>Fleeing Spain as it becomes engulfed in Civil War, the immortal vampire Saint-Germain heads for California, where he is reunited with Rowena Saxon, unaware that Cenere, a ruthless assassin, is pursuing him and will do anything, even kill those under Saint-Germain&#39;s protection, to achieve his objective. 20,000 first printing.</p><p>Chelsea Quinn Yarbro lives in San Francisco, California.Set in the 1930s, Yarbro's 16th assured Count Saint-Germain adventure takes the 4,000-year-old vampire to the United States. First, however, he must flee an unstable Spain on the eve of civil war, a move that costs him a lucrative airplane manufacturing business and gains him dangerous new enemies. Encounters in Boston and during a cross-country trip with the ever-faithful Rogerio reveal an America gripped by the Great Depression and wary of "foreigners." He's relieved to arrive in San Francisco, where he reunites with the now-mature but still desirable artist Rowena Saxon (first met in Writ in Blood), but his stay there proves less safe-for both himself and his friends-than he had hoped. Vintner Carlo Pietragnelli, sustained financially by the Count through the years of Prohibition, and his neighbors are suffering theft by "midnight harvesters," but a bigger threat comes from the murderous Ku Klux Klan-like White Legion. Meanwhile, a ruthless assassin has followed Saint-Germain from Europe. Though far from fast-paced or action-packed, the novel provides fascinating historical detail interspersed with sensual interludes and enough intrigue to sustain interest. Intelligent parallels with the present provide depth. The difficulties 20th-century life presents for a vampire are well handled by the remarkably consistent author, who is, as always, true to her character. Like its immortal protagonist, this long-running series deserves to live on.<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Greetings from the 50 States, How They Got Their Names</h2><p>Discover the origins of each State&#39;s name, whether it came from European royalty, was adopted from a Native American word, was taken from a geographic feature, or resulted from a battle over spelling or pronunciation, each has its unique story.

These four volumes offer the original scripts from the series, including material edited from the broadcast versions that ran from 1977 to 1981 on PBS stations nationwide.Many believe that Meeting of Minds is the most brilliant series ever to be written for television. The show provides a groundbreaking opportunity to be exposed to ideas by way of a medium not normally known for its intellectual vigor.Indeed, Meeting of Minds grew out of Allen&#39;s frustration with the mediocrity of the average network program. He envisioned the show as a stimulating round-table discussion conducted like any other talk show - except that the participants would be actors portraying some of the greatest minds and most prominent figures of history. Accordingly, such characters as Aristotle, Catherine the Great, Oliver Cromwell, Emily Dickinson, Margaret Sanger, Gandhi, Thomas Paine, Cleopatra, Theodore Roosevelt, and St. Thomas Aquinas appear in startlingly effective juxtaposition, their characters revealed through brilliantly conceived dialogue.This first volume features appearances by President Theodore Roosevelt, Queen Cleopatra, Thomas Aquinas, Thomas Paine, President Ulysses S. Grant, Queen Marie Antoinette, Sir Thomas More, Karl Marx, Charles Darwin, Emily Dickinson, Galileo Galilei, and Attila the Hun.The scripts for Meeting of Minds make for excellent reading, distilling an enormous amount of research into a lively format that has the undeniable veracity of historical fact. The result is unfailingly witty, thought-provoking, and geniunely entertaining.Steve Allen&#39;s lucidity and fertile intelligence are evident on every page. Meeting of Minds remains one of the freshest, most delightful ways of gaining historical perspective ever devised, an incomparable tour de force with the power to make history come alive.</p><p><b>Steve Allen </b>(1921-2000) was known as television's renaissance man.

He flashed back sixteen years, to the last time he had lied to his father, the lie that caused so much heartbreak and devastation, a lie that started a tragic ripple that, finally, disastrously, would end here.</p><p>His father&#x2019;s eyes remained closed, his breathing raspy and uneven. Tubes seemed to snake out from everywhere. Myron stared down at his father&#x2019;s forearm. He remembered as a child visiting his dad in that Newark warehouse, the way his father sat at his oversized desk, his sleeves rolled up. The forearm had been powerful enough back then to strain the fabric, making the cuff work tourniquet-like against the muscle. Now the muscle looked spongy, deflated by age. The barrel chest that had made Myron feel so safe was still there, but it had grown brittle, as though a hand pressing down could snap the rib cage like dried twigs. His father&#x2019;s unshaven face had gray splotches instead of his customary five o&#x2019;clock shadow, the skin around his chin loose, sagging down like a cloak one size too big.</p><p>Myron&#x2019;s mother&#x2014;Al Bolitar&#x2019;s wife for the past forty-three years&#x2014;sat next to the bed. Her hand, shaking with Parkinson&#x2019;s, held his. She too looked shockingly frail. In her youth, his mother had been an early feminist, burning her bra with Gloria Steinem, wearing T-shirts that read stuff like &#x201c;A Woman&#x2019;s Place Is in the House . . . and Senate.&#x201d; Now, here they both were, Ellen and Al Bolitar (&#x201c;We&#x2019;re El-Al,&#x201d; Mom always joked, &#x201c;like the Israeli airline&#x201d;) ravaged by age, hanging on, luckier by far than the vast majority of aging lovers&#x2014;and yet this was what luck looked like in the end.</p><p>God has some sense of humor.</p><p>&#x201c;So,&#x201d; Mom said to Myron in a low voice. &#x201c;We agree?&#x201d;</p><p>Myron did not reply. The prettiest of lies versus the ugliest truth. Myron should have learned his lesson back then, sixteen years ago, with that last lie to this great man he loved like no other. But, no, it wasn&#x2019;t so simple. The ugliest truth could be devastating. It could rock a world.</p><p>Or even kill.</p><p>So as his father&#x2019;s eyes fluttered open, as this man Myron treasured like no other looked up at his oldest son with pleading, almost childlike confusion, Myron looked at his mother and slowly nodded. Then he bit back the tears and prepared to tell his father one final lie.</p><p><b>2</b></p><p><b>SIX DAYS EARLIER</b></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><b>P</b>lease, Myron, I need your help.&#x201d;</p><p>This was, for Myron, a bit of a fantasy: a shapely, gorgeous damsel in distress sauntering into his office like something out of an old Bogey film&#x2014;except, well, the saunter was more of a waddle and the shapeliness was coming from the fact that the gorgeous damsel was eight months pregnant, and really, sorry, that kind of killed the whole fantasy effect.</p><p>Her name was Suzze T, short for Trevantino, a retired tennis star. She had been the sexy bad girl of the tour, better known for her provocative outfits, piercings, and tattoos than for her actual game. Still Suzze won a major and made a ton in endorsements, most notably as the spokeswoman (Myron loved that euphemism) for La-La-Latte, a chain of topless coffee bars, where college boys loved to snicker for &#x201c;extra milk.&#x201d; Good times.</p><p>Myron spread his arms. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m here for you, Suzze, twenty-four/ seven&#x2014;you know that.&#x201d;</p><p>They were in his Park Avenue office, home of MB Reps, the <i>M</i> standing for Myron, the <i>B</i> for Bolitar, and the Reps because they represented athletes, actors, and writers. Literal-Monikers-R-Us.</p><p>&#x201c;Just tell me what I can do.&#x201d;</p><p>Suzze began to pace. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure where to begin.&#x201d; Myron was about to speak when she held up her hand. &#x201c;And if you dare say, &#x2018;Start at the beginning,&#x2019; I will rip off one of your testicles.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Just one?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re engaged now. I&#x2019;m thinking of your poor fianc�e.&#x201d;</p><p>The pace turned more into a stomp, picking up speed and intensity so that a small part of Myron feared that she might go into labor right here in his recently refurbished office.</p><p>&#x201c;Uh, the carpet,&#x201d; Myron said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s new.&#x201d;</p><p>She frowned, paced some more, started biting her exuberantly polished fingernails.</p><p>&#x201c;Suzze?&#x201d;</p><p>She stopped. Their eyes met.</p><p>&#x201c;Tell me,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;You remember when we first met?&#x201d;</p><p>Myron nodded. He was just a few months out of law school and starting up his fledgling firm. Back then, at the inception, MB Reps had been known as MB SportsReps. That was because initially Myron represented only athletes. When he started representing actors and writers and others in the field of the arts and celebrity, he dropped the Sports from the name, ergo, MB Reps.</p><p>Again with the literal.</p><p>&#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;I was a mess, wasn&#x2019;t I?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You were a great tennis talent.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And a mess. Don&#x2019;t sugarcoat it.&#x201d;</p><p>Myron put his palms toward the ceiling. &#x201c;You were eighteen.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Seventeen.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Seventeen, whatever.&#x201d; Quick memory flash of Suzze in the sun: blond hair in a ponytail, a wicked grin on her face, her forehand whipping the ball as though it had offended her. &#x201c;You&#x2019;d just turned pro. Adolescent boys hung your poster in their bedrooms. You were supposed to beat legends right away. Your parents redefined pushy. It&#x2019;s a miracle you stayed upright.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good point.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So what&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201d;</p><p>Suzze glanced down at her belly as though it had just appeared. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m pregnant.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Uh, yeah, I can see that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Life is good, you know?&#x201d; Her voice was soft now, wistful. &#x201c;After all the years, when I was a mess . . . I found Lex. His music has never been better. The tennis academy is doing great. And, well, it&#x2019;s just all so good now.&#x201d;</p><p>Myron waited. Her eyes stayed on her belly, cradling it as though it were its contents, which, Myron surmised, it kind of was. To keep the conversation going, Myron asked, &#x201c;Do you like being pregnant?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The actual physical act of carrying a child?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;</p><p>She shrugged. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not like I&#x2019;m glowing or any of that. I mean, I&#x2019;m so ready to deliver. It&#x2019;s interesting though. Some women love being pregnant.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And you don&#x2019;t?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It feels like someone parked a bulldozer on my bladder. I think the reason women like being pregnant is because it makes them feel special. Like they&#x2019;re minor celebrities. Most women go through life without the attention, but when they&#x2019;re pregnant, people make a fuss. This may sound uncharitable, but pregnant women like the applause. Do you know what I mean?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I think so.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve already had my share of applause, I guess.&#x201d; She moved toward the window and looked out for a moment. Then she turned back toward him. &#x201c;By the way, did you notice how huge my boobs are?&#x201d;</p><p>Myron said, &#x201c;Um,&#x201d; and decided to say no more.</p><p>&#x201c;Come to think of it, I wonder whether you should contact La-La-Latte for a new photo shoot.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Strategically angled shots?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Exactly. Might be a great new campaign in these puppies.&#x201d; She cupped them in case Myron wasn&#x2019;t sure what puppies she was referencing. &#x201c;What do you think?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I think,&#x201d; Myron said, &#x201c;that you&#x2019;re stalling.&#x201d;</p><p>Her eyes were wet now. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m so damned happy.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, well, I can see where that would be a problem.&#x201d;</p><p>She smiled at that. &#x201c;I put the demons to rest. I&#x2019;ve even reconciled with my mother. Lex and I couldn&#x2019;t be more ready to have the baby. I want those demons to stay away.&#x201d;</p><p>Myron sat up. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not using again?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;God, no. Not that kind of demon. Lex and I are done with that.&#x201d;</p><p>Lex Ryder, Suzze&#x2019;s husband, was one half of the legendary band/ duo known as HorsePower&#x2014;the much lesser half, to be frank, to the supernaturally charismatic front man, Gabriel Wire. Lex was a fine if troubled musician, but he would always be John Oates to Gabriel&#x2019;s Daryl Hall, Andrew Ridgeley to Gabriel&#x2019;s George Michael, the rest of the Pussycat Dolls next to Nicole Scherz-i-something.</p><p>&#x201c;What kind of demons then?&#x201d;</p><p>Suzze reached into her purse. She plucked out something that from across the desk looked as though it might be a photograph. She stared at it for a moment and then passed it to Myron. He took a quick glance and again tried to wait her out.</p><p>Finally, just to say something, he went with the obvious: &#x201c;This is your baby&#x2019;s sonogram.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yep. Twenty-eight weeks old.&#x201d;</p><p>More silence. Again Myron broke it. &#x201c;Is there something wrong with the baby?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nothing. He&#x2019;s perfect.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He?&#x201d;</p><p>Suzze T smiled now. &#x201c;Going to have my own little man.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s pretty cool.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah. Oh, one of the reasons I&#x2019;m here: Lex and I have been talking about it. We both want you to be the godfather.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Me?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yep.&#x201d;</p><p>Myron said nothing.</p><p>&#x201c;Well?&#x201d;</p><p>Now it was Myron who had wet eyes. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d be honored.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Are you crying?&#x201d;</p><p>Myron said nothing.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re such a girl,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong, Suzze?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe nothing.&#x201d; Then: &#x201c;I think someone is out to destroy me.&#x201d;</p><p>Myron kept his eyes on the sonogram. &#x201c;How?&#x201d;</p><p>And then she showed him. She showed him two words that would echo dully in his heart for a very long time.</p><p><b>3</b></p><p><b>A</b>n hour later, Windsor Horne Lockwood III&#x2014;known to those who fear him (and that was pretty much everyone) as Win&#x2014;swaggered into Myron&#x2019;s office. Win had a great swagger, like he should be wearing a black top hat and tails and twirling a walking stick. Instead he sported a pink-and-green Lilly Pulitzer tie, a blue blazer with some kind of crest on it, and khakis with a crease sharp enough to draw blood. He had loafers, no socks, and basically looked as though he&#x2019;d just gone yachting on the SS <i>Old Money</i>.</p><p>&#x201c;Suzze T just stopped by,&#x201d; Myron said.</p><p>Win nodded, jaw jutted. &#x201c;I saw her on the way out.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Did she look upset?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t notice,&#x201d; Win said, taking a seat. Then: &#x201c;Her breasts were engorged.&#x201d;</p><p>Win.</p><p>&#x201c;She has a problem,&#x201d; Myron said.</p><p>Win leaned back, crossed his legs with his customary coiled ease. &#x201c;Explain.&#x201d;</p><p>Myron spun his computer monitor so Win could see. An hour ago, Suzze T had done something similar. He thought about those two small words. Harmless enough on their own, but life is about context. And in this context, those two words chilled the room.</p><p>Win squinted at the screen and reached into his inside breast pocket. He plucked out a pair of reading glasses. He&#x2019;d gotten them about a month ago, and though Myron would have said it was impossible, they made Win look even more haughty and stuck-up. They also depressed the hell out of him. Win and he weren&#x2019;t old&#x2014;not by a long shot&#x2014;but to use Win&#x2019;s golf analogy when he had first unveiled the glasses: &#x201c;We are officially on the back nine of life.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Is this a Facebook page?&#x201d; Win asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes. Suzze said she uses it to promote her tennis academy.&#x201d;</p><p>Win leaned a little closer. &#x201c;Is that her sonogram?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And how does a sonogram promote her tennis academy?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what I asked. She said you need the personal touch. People don&#x2019;t just want to read self-promotion.&#x201d;</p><p>Win frowned. &#x201c;So she posts a sonogram of a fetus?&#x201d; He glanced up. &#x201c;Does that make sense to you?&#x201d;</p><p>In truth, it did not. And once again&#x2014;with Win wearing reading glasses and the two of them whining about the new world of social networks&#x2014;Myron felt old.</p><p>&#x201c;Check out the picture comments,&#x201d; Myron said.</p><p>Win gave him the flat eyes. &#x201c;People comment on a sonogram?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Just read them.&#x201d;</p><p>Win did.

Nevertheless, people matter at AMD. For almost 30 years, AMD has led the industry in establishing incentives and policies that have made it a leader within an often harsh competitive environment. </p><p>From the beginning, the companys chief founder, Chairman and CEO Jerry Sanders, was determined to build an organization that embodied the ideals in which he believed and fought for his entire life: that employees are at the core of success; rewarding merit brings out the best in people; and that loyalty is earned through fair treatment. </p><p>Like many of the pioneers of Silicon Valley, Sanders worked at Fairchild Semiconductor, where he excelled in the freewheeling environment. But a new management came into place that didnt tolerate dissent and Sanders soon left the company. </p><p>In 1969, while pondering his next move at a rented beach house in Malibu, he was asked by other Fairchild expatriates to lead a new semiconductor venture. Here was his chance to put ideas into action. Recalling his own experiences when hard work and accomplishments went unnoticed, Sanders established one of the first bonus incentive systems in the semiconductor industry. When AMD prospered, its employees prospered with it. </p><p>By 1998, AMD had become the fifth-largest U.S. merchant-supplier of integrated circuits, with 12,000 employees worldwide and revenues of more than $2.4 billion.</p></p><p>AUTHOR, COLUMNIST, HISTORIAN <p>Jeff was born in Minneapolis, MN, and grew up in the Land of 10,000 Lakes, accounting for an early interest in boating.

No, not him!But when Grandma shuts that door . . .</p><p>Squeeeak!</p><p>How can Grandma keep that spooky, squeaky door from scaring her little boy awake at night?</p><p>Acclaimed storyteller Margaret Read MacDonald and illustrator Mary Newell DePalma spin an old folktale into a humorous bedtime story.</p></p><p><p>Margaret Read MacDonald is a storyteller, author, folklorist, and children's librarian, whom <em>School Library Journal</em> has called "a grand dame of storytelling." Ms. MacDonald is the author of numerous books, including pickin' peas, illustrated by Pat Cummings, and the award-winning book <em>The Parents' Guide to Storytelling</em>. She lives in Kirkland, Washington.</p>PreS-Gr. 2. MacDonald--storyteller, author, and children's librarian--brings her experience to bear in this straightforward retelling of an old favorite, distinguished by the way the words are set down on the page. Ellipses, uppercase letters, exclamation points, and divergent spellings ("squeeeeeak!") signal readers to pause, raise or lower their voices, or inject drama into the cumulative tale of a misguided grandma who is certain a critter (or several) can help her grandson adjust to sleeping in a big-boy bed. When she realizes what's really causing the problem, she finds a quick solution: "She oiled that squeaky door." The art is as distinctive as the text. DePalma's illustrations, diminutive and detailed, envision a cozy home and loving grandma, whose comical endeavors to outfit animals in pj's and kiss them goodnight ("smack!") brim with clever touches, while double-page spreads reflect the child's apprehension and loneliness by gradually increasing the distance between the bed and the slowly closing door. Numerous spot illustrations make this impractical for pajama parties, but for lap sharing before bed, it is just perfect. <i>Stephanie Zvirin</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

In this entertaining and informative book, historian Michael Fry shows how Americans of Scottish heritage helped shape this country, from its founding days to the present. They were courageous pioneers, history-changing revolutionaries, great Presidents, doughty fighters, inspiring writers, learned teachers, intrepid explorers, daring frontiersmen, and of course buccaneering businessmen, media moguls, and capitalists throughout American history. <br><br>The Scots' unflappable spirit and hardy disposition helped them take root among the earliest settlements and become some of the British colonies' foremost traders. During the Revolution, the teachings of the great Scottish philosophers and economists would help to shape the democracy that thrived in America as in no other part of the world. America may have separated from the British Empire, but the Scottish influence on the young continent never left.<br><br>Armed with an inimitable range of historical knowledge, Fry charts the exchange of ideas and values between the Scotland and America that led to many of the greatest achievements in business, science, and the arts. Finally, he takes readers into the twentieth century, in which the Scots serve as the ideal example of a people that have embraced globalization without losing their sense of history, culture and national identity.<br><br>Scottish Americans have been incomparable innovators in every branch of American society, and their fascinating story is brilliantly captured in this new book by one of Scotland's leading historians. <i>How the Scots Made America</i> is not only a must-read for all those with Scottish ancestry but for anyone interested in knowing the full story behind the roots of the American way of life.<br></p><p>International praise for Michael Fry:<br><br>"His range is striking, his breadth of interest amazing."<br>- <i>Times Literary Supplement</i><br><br>"In all his prolific writings he brings a historian's depth to journalism and a journalist's popularism to history... frequently magnificent." <br>- <i>Financial Times</i><br><br>"He warms to big characters and colorful yarns."<br>- <i>Scotland on Sunday</i><br><br>"Charmingly combines journalistic flair with scholarly weight."<br>- <i>The Scotsman</i><br><br>"He deserves to knock sleekit metropolitan performers like Simon Schama off the map...

Blessed with total recall, Jarman made a perfect coauthor for this book.</p><h2>Gangster</h2><p>Love. Violence. Destiny. These powerful themes ricochet through Lorenzo Carcaterra's new novel like bullets from a machine gun. In Gangster, he surpasses even his bestselling Sleepers to create a brutal and brilliant American saga of murder, forgiveness, and redemption.<br><br>Born in the midst of tragedy and violence and raised in the shadow of a shocking secret, young Angelo Vestieri chooses to flee both his past and his father to seek a second family--the criminals who preside over early 20th century New York. In his bloody rise from soldier to mob boss, he encounters ever more barbaric betrayals--in friendship, in his brutal business, in love-- yet simultaneously comes to understand the meaning of loyalty, the virtue of relationships, and gains a perspective on the lonely, if powerful, life he has chosen.<br><br>As the years pass, as enemies are made and defeated, as wars are fought and won, the old don meets an abandoned boy who needs a parent as much as protection. By taking Gabe under his wing and teaching him everything he knows, Angelo Vestieri will learn, in the winter of his life, which is greater: his love for the boy he cherishes, or his need to be a gangster and to live by the savage rules he helped create.<br><br>A sweeping panoramic with riveting characters, a unique understanding of the underworld philosophy, and a relentless pace, Gangster travels through the time of godfathers and goodfellas to our own world of suburban Sopranos. But this is more than just an authentic chronicle of crime. Setting a new standard for this acclaimed author, Gangster is a compassionate portrait of one man's fight against his fate--and an unforgettable epic of a family, a city, a century.</p><p>It will come as no surprise to anyone who understands the derivative nature of filmmaking that Lorenzo Carcaterra's newest has already been bought for a TV miniseries. After all, how many times can you rerun all three parts of <i>The Godfather</i>? Here the author of <i>Sleepers</i> and <i>Apaches</i> provides a full accounting of the life of one Angelo Vestiere, told from the perspective of two people who witnessed it firsthand: Gabe, the street kid who ultimately betrayed Angelo's hope that he would succeed him; and Mary, the woman who loved him. One knows a secret about the other, which isn't revealed until the book's final pages. But by that time the secret doesn't matter and sheds no more light on Angelo than the reader has gleaned in the previous chapters.<p> Angelo has few redeeming characteristics. As the protagonist of this sprawling novel of the rise of organized crime in America, he never earns the reader's empathy, despite Carcaterra's attempts to humanize his central character by presenting the "code of the gangster" as a believable rationale for Angelo's existence and his success in his chosen career. By far the more interesting thugs who people this book are Pudge, Angus McQueen, and Ida the Goose, a trio of fellow gangsters the author pulls into Angelo's orbit. Despite their moral and ethical shortcomings, they are picaresque enough to have a certain raffish charm. But Angelo is no Don Corleone or even Tony Soprano. And while Carcaterra's a journeyman writer, he's not ready to inherit the mantle of the late (and in this case sadly lamented) Mario Puzo. <i>--Jane Adams</i></p>Lorenzo Carcaterra is the author of the memoir A Safe Place, Apaches, and the New York Times bestseller Sleepers.

The authors unaccountably begin their account in the 17th century and bring it through 1939. The text discusses cavalry tactics and organization and gives examples of its use in various wars. The coverage, however, is uneven and often sketchy. The best part is the numerous color paintings of specific uniforms, impeccably detailed. The book is attractive, but contains insufficient data to make it suitable as a reference work. John Ellis's Cavalry: The History of Mounted Warfare (LJ 12/15/78) remains preferable.<br><i>- Raymond L.

Discover how to dress for dumpster diving success, work your neighborhood dumpsters, dive a restaurant, use a &#34;bag blade&#34; and &#34;dive stick&#34;, handle run-ins with the authorities, convert your trash to cash, and much more! While you are learning all these professional secrets, you will be entertained by outrageous anecdotes from a life-long master diver.</p><p>"Dumpster diving" is an unfortunate term for a noble pursuit: reclaiming and reusing perfectly good things that are being thrown away by wasteful or lazy people. It is also a political act highly frowned upon in materialistic societies because it removes one from obligate consumerism. And John Hoffman has written the ultimate guide for perfecting the art. A college graduate with a good job, Hoffman doesn't have to Dumpster dive: he loves to, and lives better--and more freely--because of it. In nations like America, there is an incredible amount of great stuff--often in great shape--thrown out every day. And Hoffman tells you how to claim it as your own. <p> At this point, I have a confession to make: I am a sometime Dumpster diver myself. Almost all of the furniture in our house has been found abandoned on the streets in our upper-middle-class neighborhood or nearby college campuses: sofas, tables, bookcases, lamps... you name it--even some of our several household computers! Personally, I wouldn't do some of what Hoffman advocates (such as diving for food), but as in the tradition of all Loompanics Press books, this is a no-holds-barred, tell-all book that assumes its readers can make decisions appropriate to their own lives.</p>John Hoffman is a bona fide fringe writer and his previous employment is equally checkered &#x2013; he has worked as a psychiatric counselor, printer&#x2019;s assistant, security guard, pizza cook, soldier, activist, newspaper reporter, hotel clerk, apartment manager and city councilman.

Very Good conditions. May have soft reading marks and name of the previous owner.</p><p>The Princess de Cleves, the first great short novel in the French language, was published anonymously in 1678, although &#39;advance publicity&#39; has made it clear that the author was Madame de Lafayette (with the probable assistance of La Rochefoucauld and others). The book caused a sensation then, and is now considered one of the French classics. Although this is a historical novel, set in the last splendid days of Henri II of France, it does in fact reflect the manners and morals of the court of Louix XIV: and in this artificial setting of gossip, deceit and intrigue (ably fostered by the teenage Mary, Queen of Scots), the tortures passions of the gallant Duc de Nemours and the radiant wife of the Prince de Cleves shine out with a pure brilliance.</p><h2>Clone: The Life and Legacy of Al Parker, Gay Superstar</h2><p>Al Parker's story, as uncovered by Edmonson, reveals a young man out of place in his world who would find his home in front of and behind the camera as the star of 21 adult films and the founder of Surge Studios, celebrating the rough and raw sexuality he came to symbolize. And like so many young men of his day, he would be cut down early in life by AIDS-but not before making an even more lasting impact as a crusader who was willing to put his career on the line to make a statement about safer-sex practices, a statement that would immortalize him finally as the personification of a more responsible gay sexuality.<br><br><b>Roger Edmonson</b> is the author of <i>Boy in the Sand: Casey Donovan, All-American Sex Star</i> and <i>Silverwolf</i> He lives in Seattle.<br></p><p>Roger Edmonson is the author of Boy in the Sand: Casey Donovan, All-American Sex Star and Silverwolf along with two other full-length novels and several acclaimed anthologies of short fiction.

He lives in Seattle.Drew Okun was born on June 25, 1952 in Natick, Massachusetts, a town of 20,000 situated on the banks of the Charles River, 18 miles southwest of Boston. His family was solidly middle-class and upwardly mobile. Both parents grew up in Brooklyn, where they were best friends with another couple whose daughter, Janie Schramm, went on to become Drew's lifelong pal. "Both sets of parents were pretty hip," she told me. "Then Drew's folks married, moved to Natick and became very middle class." Seymour, Drew's father, worked as a salesman for a chemical company. Drew's mother, Shirley, began work welding transistors to boards on an assembly line at a firm that manufactured computer components, and within six years had become its Vice President. <p>Drew and Janie were very close as children. "I met him when I was just a baby. Whenever I knew they were coming, I remember I'd get so excited. His folks would come to visit my folks in Queens and we'd make the pilgrimage out to Natick. Drew did some research once and discovered we were really distant blood relations. We decided to call each other cousins to make it easier to explain our relationship. </p><p>"Drew had a rather difficult childhood. He was always a little reserved because his folks were so strict, especially his mom. I remember Drew as being really well-behaved. I was into everything and his mom would sometimes get mad at me when we were together." Drew and Janie egged each other on, naturally enough, stirring up all kinds of mischief. "Once we finger-painted the side of my house and got into a whole lot of trouble. Another time we bought some of those explosive caps that go into cigarettes and booby-trapped our parents' packs. They always sat around the table after dinner, arguing about politics and smoking. Drew and I watched and waited while our parents talked. Finally, my mom picked up her pack of cigarettes and took one out. She lit up, and BOOM!, it went off. We bolted out the back door and ran like hell." When they weren't getting into trouble, they were out playing. "Natick was an old town. There was Revolutionary War stuff all over the place--you know, statues and plaques. Drew was fascinated by graveyards, the older the better. I remember there was also open country around their house so we were able to run and play in the fields. When Drew came to visit me in the city, we'd play something we called 'Dizzyland.' We'd draw circles and spirals on the street and walk around and around until we were dizzy. He also had a little reel-to-reel tape recorder that we'd use to create Ed Sullivan type variety shows. We'd imitate singers and comics. He was a great mimic." </p><p>The one thing Janie would never have figured Drew to become when he grew up was a porn legend. "He was so, well, mousy as a youngster. He was really into radio. He had a short-wave set and listened to broadcasts from around the world. I remember him as being into all the typical boy stuff like making scale models. As he got older, he was really into cars. His dad was into it also, so it was something they shared. The Okuns bought a new car every year, which struck me as really amazing. Drew loved cars all his life." Seymour Okun said, "Of all the hobbies Drew had, automobiles were the best. He could identify any car when he was young. He had a '64 Mercury convertible in high school. One time something went wrong with the car and Drew and his pals took it out into the back yard and rebuilt the engine. </p><p>"He was an exuberant kid with plenty of friends, male and female. He went to YMCA camp in the summers. Drew was a good amateur athlete. He played baseball, he swam, he went boating. He did all the things kids his age did. He was always very industrious. He had little jobs when he was in school. I remember he delivered for a pharmacy. When he was growing up there was never any indication he was gay. If he knew, there was no way he let on to us." </p><p>He had one older sister, Meg, five years his senior. Janie remembers Meg as "achievement oriented. She was an excellent pianist, then she became a doctor. Meg was brilliant." Drew was not her equal academically, and he was always in her shadow. Drew admired his sister, although they were never close. In later years, they were totally estranged. </p><p>In this achievement-oriented family, Drew was something of an odd-man-out. Nothing in his early years at school marked him for fame and fortune. "If I went back to a high school reunion, I'd be one of those people nobody would remember," he once quipped to a friend. He wasn't the tallest guy in his class, or the handsomest, or the strongest. In fact, at 5'8"--about an inch less, according to some sources--and 140 pounds, he was on the scrawny side and tended toward a nerdy invisibility in the halls and classrooms of Natick High School. </p><p>In spite of this, those in the know recognized early on that there was something special about young Drew. There was one place where he was not only visible, he was a standout. This was first brought to his attention when a seventh grade classmate took a look at him in the showers after gym class, then proceeded to expound on the size of Drew's penis to all and sundry. "I had never really thought about the size of my cock," Drew recalled, "until I was saddled with the nickname 'Pony Boy.'"</p></p><h2>The Day of the Triffids (S.F.Masterworks S.)</h2><p>When Bill Masen wakes up in his hospital bed, he has reason to be grateful for the bandages that covered his eyes the night before. For he finds a population rendered helpless by the blindness that followed the spectacular display of bright green lights that filled the night sky; a population at the mercy of the Triffids. Once, with their ability to move and their carnivorous habits, the Triffids were just botanical curiosities. But now, with humans so vulnerable, they are a potent threat to humanity&#39;s survival. It is up to people like Bill, the few who can still see, to carve out a future...</p><p>THE DAY OF THE TRIFFIDS<br>A truly scary classic of a world at war with incomprehensible forces. A must read book and, a must see movie.<br><p>--Fred Dodnick, Vice President, Director of Trade Production</p>In 1951 John Wyndham published his novel "The Day of the Triffids to moderate acclaim. Fifty-two years later, this horrifying story is a science fiction classic, touted by "The Times (London) as having "all the reality of a vividly realized nightmare." <br>Bill Masen, bandages over his wounded eyes, misses the most spectacular meteorite shower England has ever seen. Removing his bandages the next morning, he finds masses of sightless people wandering the city. He soon meets Josella, another lucky person who has retained her sight, and together they leave the city, aware that the safe, familiar world they knew a mere twenty-four hours before is gone forever. <br>But to survive in this post-apocalyptic world, one must survive the Triffids, strange plants that years before began appearing all over the world. The Triffids can grow to over seven feet tall, pull their roots from the ground to walk, and kill a man with one quick lash of their poisonous stingers. With society in shambles, they are now poised to prey on humankind. Wyndham chillingly anticipates bio-warfare and mass destruction, fifty years before their realization, in this prescient account of Cold War paranoia.</p><h2>Songs of the 1930&#39;s: The Decade Series</h2><p>(Piano/Vocal/Guitar Songbook). 61 songs, featuring: All of Me * The Continental * I Can&#39;t Get Started * I&#39;m Getting Sentimental Over You * In the Mood * The Lady Is a Tramp * Love Letters in the Sand * My Funny Valentine * Smoke Gets in Your Eyes * What a Diff&#39;rence a Day Made.</p><p>Founded in 1947, Hal Leonard Corporation has become the worlds largest print music publisher, representing some of the greatest songwriters and artists of all time.

There, Celestine shyly joins him in the center ring, and together they become the toast of the bigtop. Like Vincent's other titles about these quietly endearing characters, this is a warm and gentle vignette from the daily life of two caring friends. As usual, Vincent's black-line sketches fill their frames with movement, while the pale, sepia-toned washes give a homey, old-fashioned feeling to the story. Occasional touches of pale pink, blue, and red add a welcome note of contrast. Although undetailed, the characters' faces are remarkably expressive. Celestine's figure is especially well rendered, with postures that speak sulkiness, shyness, embarassment, and exuberance. The illustrations move the story along admirably. In fact, the story works better without words. The textual story, written as a dialogue between the two characters, reads like a gracelessly literal translation and becomes an impediment to the enjoyment of the stronger visual story going on above. Despite the problems with the text, though, the strength of these books and the reason for their continuing popularity is obvious in the display of gentleness and warmth between Ernest, the grown-up; and Celestine, the child. --Linda Boyles, Alachua County Lib .

He met her in the hall, not, she believed, of design, and favoured her with a nod. 'It's you, is it?' he said ungraciously. 'Somewhat unexpected, this visit, I must say. Hope you had a good journey.' </p> <p>Miss Fawcett was a young lady not easily discouraged. Moreover, she had been General Sir Arthur Billington- Smith's sister-in-law for five years, and cherished no illusions about him. She shook him briskly by the hand, and replied with perfect equanimity: 'You know quite well it's impossible to have a good journey on this rotten line, Arthur. And how you can say I'm unexpected when I sent an expensive telegram to prepare you both for the joy in store for you &#x2014;'</p> <p>The General's scowl deepened. 'Short notice, you'll admit!' he said. 'I suppose you've brought a ridiculous quantity of baggage?'</p> <p>'Something tells me,' remarked Miss Fawcett intelligently, 'that I'm not really welcome.'</p> <p>'Oh, I've no doubt Fay's delighted!' replied the General, with a short laugh. 'Though where she is I don't know. She packs the house with visitors, but can't trouble herself to be here when they arrive.'</p> <p>At this moment his erring wife came down the stairs. 'Oh, darling!' she said in a voice that held a plaintive note. 'How lovely to see you! How are you?'</p> <p>Miss Fawcett embraced her warmly. 'Hullo, Fay! Why didn't you send a wire to put me off ? Arthur's all upset about it.'</p> <p>The large, rather strained blue eyes flew apprehensively to the General's face. 'Oh, no!' Fay said. 'Arthur doesn't mind having you, Dinah. Do you, Arthur dear?'</p> <p>'Oh, not at all!' said the General. 'You'd better take her up to her room instead of keeping her standing about in the hall.'</p> <p>'Yes, of course,' Fay said. 'You'd like to come up, wouldn't you, Dinah?'</p> <p>This was said a trifle beseechingly, and Miss Fawcett, who wore all the signs of one about to do battle, relaxed, and agreed that she would like to go up to her room.</p> <p>'I've had to put you in the little west room,' Fay told her. 'I knew you wouldn't mind. We're &#x2014; we're rather full up.'</p> <p>'Yes, so I gathered,' said Dinah, rounding the bend of the staircase. 'It seems to be worrying little Arthur.'</p> <p>She had a clear, carrying voice. Fay glanced quickly down the stairs. 'Dinah, please!' she begged.</p> <p>Dinah threw her a glance of slightly scornful affection, and replied incorrigibly: 'All right, but it's putting an awful strain on me.'</p> <p>They ascended the remaining stairs in silence, but as soon as the door of the west room was securely shut on them Dinah demanded to know what was the matter with Arthur.</p> <p>Lady Billington-Smith sank down on to a chair, and put up one of her thin hands to her head, pushing the pale gold hair off her brow in a nervous gesture peculiar to her. 'Something dreadful has happened,' she answered. 'It has upset Arthur terribly.'</p> <p>'Ha!' said Dinah, casting her hat on to the bed. 'The cook burned his Sacred Porridge, I suppose.'</p> <p>A slight smile flickered across her sister's face. 'Oh, don't be an ass, Dinah, for heaven's sake!'</p> <p>'Well, that was it the last time I came,' said Dinah, hunting in her dressing-case for a comb.</p> <p>'This is much worse. It's Geoffrey.'</p> <p>'Dipped again?' inquired Miss Fawcett sympathetically. 'Worse than that, even. He's engaged to be married. At least, he says he is.'</p> <p>Miss Fawcett combed out her short brown locks, and began to powder her nose. 'Barmaid, or tobacconist's assistant?' she asked, as one versed in the follies of young men.</p> <p>'Neither. She's a cabaret dancer.'</p> <p>Miss Fawcett gave a crow of laughter. 'Oh, no! No cabaret dancer would fall for Geoffrey.'</p> <p>'Well, this one has. And it isn't even as though she's English. She's a Mexican.' Lady Billington-Smith allowed this piece of information to sink in, and followed it up by a final announcement. 'And he's bringing her here to spend the week-end.'</p> <p>'But how rich! how luscious!' exclaimed Dinah. 'I wouldn't have missed it for anything. Has Geoffrey gone mad, do you suppose? Who is the girl?'</p> <p>'Her name,' replied Fay, 'is Lola de Silva. It sounds awfully improbable, doesn't it? It &#x2014; it put Arthur off right away. I've had rather a dreadful time with him, because Geoffrey wrote to me, not to his father, and &#x2014; and asked me to break the news. I'm afraid Geoffrey's quite infatuated. He seems to think Arthur has only to see this Lola person and he'll fall for her.'</p> <p>'The joys of being a stepmother,' commented Dinah. 'Is that what Arthur meant when he said that you'd packed the house full of people?'</p> <p>'Partly, I expect. But he's blaming me for having the Hallidays now, just because he'd rather they weren't here when Geoffrey comes.'</p> <p>'And who,' asked Dinah, 'are the Hallidays? Kindly enumerate.'</p> <p>'People we met in the south of France,' replied Fay, a little guardedly. 'He was knocked up in the War, and she's &#x2014; she's rather pretty, and smart.' She raised her eyes to her sister's face and coloured faintly. 'Well, you're bound to see it. Arthur flirts with her. That's why they're here.'</p> <p>'More fool you to invite them,' said Dinah sternly.</p> <p>'You don't understand. Arthur made me.' Dinah snorted.</p> <p>'It's no good, Dinah. You're the fighting sort, and I'm not. Anyway, it doesn't matter. He doesn't mean anything serious, and if it keeps him in a good temper I don't mind.'</p> <p>'Anyone else here?' asked Dinah, abandoning a hopeless topic.</p> <p>'Yes, Francis. He arrived in time for lunch.'</p> <p>Dinah grimaced. 'If I'd known he was going to be here I wouldn't have come. What's he turned up for? To touch dear Uncle Arthur? That'll make it a very merry party. Anyone else?'</p> <p>Fay got up, apparently to rearrange the flowers that stood in a vase on the dressing-table. 'Only Stephen Guest,' she replied. 'He said he'd be here in time for tea.'</p> <p>'Oh!' said Dinah.</p></p><h2>The Crossword Murder (Prime Crime)</h2><p>When colorful crossword editor Thompson C. Briephs turns up dead under mysterious circumstances, private detective Rosco Polycrates joins forces with a beautiful crossword editor from the victim&#39;s rival newspaper to find the killer before he or she strikes again, in an entertaining mystery accompanied by six crossword puzzles. Original.</p><p>Designed to delight both crossword puzzle enthusiasts and mystery readers, this pseudonymous novel, the first in a projected series from the husband-and-wife team of Cordelia Frances Biddle (Beneath the Wind) and Steve Zettler (Double Identity), features adroit wordplay and high society intrigue. Wealthy Thomas C. Briephs is a crossword puzzle editor for the Newport, Mass., Herald, and a man-about-town whose immoral private life has made him an easy target for blackmail. Yet when he dies under unusual circumstances (strangulation in his bed), the police declare the death accidental, the result of a kinky sex game gone wrong, and try to hush up the affair in order to protect the reputation of Briephs's uncle, a U.S. senator. Briephs's mother, however, asks Greek-American private detective Rosco Polycrates to conduct a discreet investigation. Seeking background information, Rosco interviews Mrs. Annabella "Belle" Graham, the crossword editor for another Newcastle paper. The deeper Rosco investigates, the murkier the case gets, especially when two of Briephs's crosswords are published posthumously. At first Rosco is inclined to scoff at Belle's idea that the puzzles hold vital clues to the murder, but he reconsiders after Briephs's assistant is brutally attacked and three remaining puzzles disappear. Fighting a growing attraction, Rosco and Belle fill in the blanks as they edge toward the killer's true motive. Though Blanc's descriptions are awkward in spots and his secondary characters tend to be overblown, he delivers an enjoyable, complex solution and likable protagonists who are strong enough to carry the series forward. In a clever innovation, the text includes Briephs's final crosswords, which puzzle buffs can try to decipher before Rosco and Belle do. (Aug.) <br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.Evoe! At last puzzle fans have their revenge... super sleuthing and solving for puzzle lovers and mystery fans. -- <i>Charles Preston, Puzzle Editor, USA Today</i><br><br>If life were a crossword puzzle, everything would be black and white. Life and death are a cryptic - as crossword buffs call them - in The Crossword Murder (Berkley Prime Crime), and Nero Blanc (Black White) is the perfect pen name for local authors husband and wife Cordelia Frances Biddle and Steve Zettler. In this mystery, wealthy self-appointed genius crossword author Thompson Briephs is murdered. He leaves behind five puzzles that may point to his killer. An eccentric cast of characters (all with 15-letter names to fill an entire line of a puzzle grid) keep the pot boiling with well-paced breaks for puzzle solving. But which words in the puzzles are important clues and which are just... words? Theres no real pattern. The authors smoothly gloss over this logical gulf, and if you too can ignore it, The Crossword Murder is good summer entertainment. A romantic subplot is deftly handled and the settings, particularly Briephs kinky (historically dubious) Cretan-maze-mansion, are fun. Although I suspect the puzzles wont challenge the skills of world-class word-wranglers, I enjoyed them. -- <i>Philadelphia City Paper</i><br><br>The Crossword Murder is a witty story of murder and skullduggery.

These mythologies shape our every thought, perception, and action, helping us to feel safe and secure in our identities. But when our personal mythologies do not grow and change along with us, we find ourselves stuck in self-defeating life patterns. In &#34;The Mythic Path&#34; David Feinstein, Ph.D., and Stanley Krippner, Ph.D., hailed by Jean Houston as &#39;masters of the geography of the inscapes&#39;, provide a series of detailed exercises developed over a combined 80 years of clinical practice, personal development workshops, and teaching on psychological topics.Using ritual, dreams, and imagination to liberate you from the mythologies of your childhood and culture, the 12-week course will ignite the mystery of a transformed inner life into authentic outer expression. This third edition of a life-changing classic has been revised to include a new Support Guide combining their ground-breaking model for incorporating Energy Psychology into the process of personal transformation.</p><p><p>David Feinstein, Ph.D., is a clinical psychologist who serves as national director of the Energy Medicine Institute.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Donna Eden has been teaching people how to understand their body's energies for more than twenty-five years. She has treated more than ten thousand clients individually and has taught hundreds of classes throughout the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Gary Craig is the founder of Emotional Freedom Techniques (EFT), the most widely used of all the techniques within the burgeoning new field of energy psychology.</p>Psychologists Feinstein and Krippner show us how to take responsibility for renewing our personal "guiding" mythologies. These myths establish our identity and provide a sense of direction and self-worth. The book explains how to identify outdated myths ("Everything I do must be perfect"), produce alternative imagery, and integrate a new vision into our life. The program uses dreams, journals, and ritual to create "personal shields," "power objects," and individualized fairy tales that will aid the transformation. During the 12 weeks, the authors explain how to identify conflicts between prevailing and emerging myths, how to understand both, and how to construct, refine, and make a commitment to live from a newly created mythology. They suggest three one-hour sessions per week as well as optional time on journaling and dream work. The authors admit that their prevailing thesis is a reiteration of the Hasidic proverb "Carefully observe which way your heart draws you, and then choose that way with all your strength." <i>Patricia Hassler</i></p><h2>Tamara Drewe by Posy Simmonds (2007-11-19)</h2><p>, [vi], [126] pages, illustrated in colour, first appeared as a serial in The Guardian</p><p>Posy Simmonds is the author of several books for adults and children, including <b>Lulu and the Flying Babies</b> and <b>Fred</b>. Her weekly cartoon strip ran in <i>The Guardian</i> from 1977 to 1987. She lives in England.Starred Review. This irresistible graphic novel by longtime <i>Guardian</i> cartoonist Simmonds is roughly based on Hardy's <i>Far from the Madding Crowd</i> and uses it to depict the English upper-middle class having tawdry midlife crises. Beth, the wife of renowned author Nicholas Hardiman, runs an idyllic writer's retreat where she's parlayed her skill at caring for her husband into caring for other writers. She and her literary charges barely notice the locals who, jammed on council estates, look on with envy. Enter young Tamara Drewe, a newspaper columnist famed for her post&#x2013;plastic surgery beauty. With Ben, her rock-star boyfriend, and her citified ways, she knocks Beth's little group on its head and gets stalked by two local girls. After Ben leaves Tamara, she decides the already adulterous Nicholas would be a nice lay on the rebound, only he falls in love with her. The art captures British frumpiness so well it's scary; middle-age spread hulks through this book like sad weight, but it's less skilled with beauty; Tamara's looks don't sway the reader the way they sway the characters in the book. But the view on how feminism has failed in moneyed Britain is priceless. A wonderful and slightly evil book. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Why does virtually every serious management book recognize, document, and praise his insights? How do his life and his legacy continue to inspire and inform the visions of today&#39;s most alert and innovative entrepreneurs? Why is global interest now mounting in his multifaceted work? &#34;Maslow laid the foundation for the human side of management. All students of an participants in the human community, especially the management and organization of work, should read this seminal biography.&#34;--Warren Bennis, Professor of Business Administration, University of Southern California, author of Leaders. Fascinating and visionary, Abraham Maslow (1908-1970) pioneered revolutionary ideas that helped form modern psychology and laid the cornerstones of contemporary marketing, motivation, self-actualization, and management trends. Critically acclaimed in its first edition and now revised and updated for this paperback edition, The Right to Be Human is a fascinating portrait of one of the seminal thinkers of the twentieth century--at once a vivid biography of a truly original personality and an intellectual journey to the very source of how we think about and manage our businesses today.Brandeis psychologist Maslow (1908-1970), a founder of humanistic psychology, was an uneasy hero of the 1960s counterculture. As spiritualistic fads swept the country, he scolded Esalen Institute instructors for their smugness and warned his followers that too much inwardness is not psychologically healthy. This apostle of self-actualization and creative "peak experiences" was an intensely private man who rarely discussed his own mystical highs. Hoffman, biographer of Wilhelm Reich, has interviewed Maslow's friends, family and students, and while he never fully pierces his subject's calm, scholarly demeanor, his thoughtful biography has its rewards. We meet Maslow the youthful sexologist of the 1930s (his findings were championed decades later by feminists); the socialist-leaning rebel who married his cousin and lived on a commune; the professor who actively disliked conformist students. The first full-scale biography of Maslow, this profile will be of interest to the many people touched by his humanistic vision of personal growth.

He quickly realizes he&#x2019;s made a mistake. He&#x2019;s replacing another actor who quit after seeing the script&#x2014;a script the director now claims doesn&#x2019;t exist. The movie is over budget. The production team seems headed for a breakdown. The air is so wet that the celluloid film disintegrates.<br> <br>But what the actor doesn&#x2019;t realize is that the greatest threat might be the town itself, and the mysterious shadow economy that powers this remote jungle outpost. Entrepreneurial Americans, international drug traffickers, and M-19 guerillas are all fighting for South America&#x2019;s future&#x2014;and the groups aren&#x2019;t as distinct as you might think. The actor thought this would be a role that would change his life.

You shouldn't anyway, because Wilson's writing style is hypnotic, tightly wound, and harrowingly evocative of the story's stifling, bug-heavy atmosphere.

He lives with his wife and children in California.</p>Two Spanish soldiers swaggered up Tower Street toward William Shakespeare. Their boots squelched in the mud. One wore a rusty corselet with his high-crowned morion, the other a similar helmet with a jacket of quilted cotton. Rapiers swung at their hips. The fellow with the corselet carried a pike longer than he was tall; the other shouldered an arquebus. Their lean, swarthy faces wore what looked like permanent sneers. <p> People scrambled out of their way: apprentices without ruffs and in plain wool caps; a pipe-smoking sailor wearing white trousers with spiral stripes of blue; a merchant's wife in a red wool doublet spotted with white-almost a man's style-who lifted her long black skirt to keep it out of puddles; a ragged farmer in from the countryside with a donkey weighted down with sacks of beans. </p><p> Shakespeare flattened himself against the rough, weather-faded timbers of a shop along with everybody else. The Spaniards had held London-held it down for Queen Isabella, daughter of Philip of Spain, and her husband, Albert of Austria-for more than nine years now. Everyone knew what happened to men rash enough to show them disrespect to their faces. </p><p> A cold, nasty autumn drizzle began sifting down from the gray sky. Shakespeare tugged his hat down lower on his forehead to keep the rain out of his eyes-and to keep the world from seeing how thin his hair was getting in front, though he was only thirty-three. He scratched at the little chin beard he wore. Where was the justice in that? </p><p> On went the Spaniards. One of them kicked at a skinny, ginger-colored dog gnawing a dead rat. The dog skittered away. The soldier almost measured himself full length in the sloppy street. His friend grabbed his arm to steady him. </p><p> Behind them, the Englishmen and -women got back to their business. A pockmarked tavern tout took Shakespeare's hand. "Try the Red Bear, friend," the fellow said, breathing beer fumes and the stink of rotting teeth into his face. "The drink is good, the wenches friendly-" </p><p> "Away with you." Shakespeare twisted free. The man's dirty hand, he noted with annoyance, had smudged the sleeve of his lime-green doublet. </p><p> "Away with me? Away with me?" the tout squeaked. "Am I a black-beetle, for you to squash?" </p><p> "Black-beetle or no, I'll spurn you with my foot if you trouble me more," Shakespeare said. He was a tall man, on the lean side but solidly made and well fed. The tout's skin stretched drumhead tight over cheekbones and jaw. He slunk off to earn his pennies-his farthings, more likely-somewhere else. </p><p> A few doors down stood the tailor's shop to which Shakespeare had been going. The man working inside peered at him through spectacles that magnified his red-tracked eyes. "Good morrow to you, Master Will," he said. "By God, I am glad to see you in health." </p><p> "And I you, Master Jenkins," Shakespeare replied. "Your good wife is well, I hope, and your son?" </p><p> "Very well, the both of them," the tailor said. "I thank you for asking. Peter would be here to greet you as well, but he is taking to the head of the fishmongers a cloak I but now finished: to their hall in Thames Street, in Bridge Ward." </p><p> "May the fishmongers' chief have joy in it," Shakespeare said. "And have you also finished the kingly robe you promised for the players?" </p><p> Behind those thick lenses, Jenkins' eyes grew bigger and wider yet. "Was that to be done today?" </p><p> Shakespeare clapped a hand to his forehead, almost knocking off his hat. As he grabbed for it, he said, "'Sblood, Master Jenkins, how many times did I tell you it was wanted on All Saints' Day, and is that not today?" </p><p> "It is. It is. And I can only cry your pardon," Jenkins said mournfully. </p><p> "That doth me no good, nor my fellow players," Shakespeare said. "Shall Burbage swagger forth in his shirt tomorrow? He'll kill me when he hears this, and I you afterwards." He shook his head at that-fury outrunning sense. </p><p> To the tailor, fury counted for more. "It's near done," he said. "If you'll but bide, I can finish it within an hour, or may my head answer for it." He made a placating gesture and, even more to the point, shoved aside the doublet on which he'd been sewing. </p><p> "An hour?" Shakespeare sighed heavily, while Jenkins gave an eager nod. Drumming his fingers on his arm, Shakespeare nodded, too. "Let it be as you say, then. Were it not that the royal robe in our tiring room looks more like a vagabond's rags and tatters, I'd show you less patience." </p><p> "Truly, Master Will, you are a great gentleman," Jenkins quavered as he took the robe of scarlet velvet from under the counter. </p><p> "I trust you'll note this unseemly delay in your price," Shakespeare said. By the tailor's expression, he found that not in the least gentlemanly. While Shakespeare kept on drumming his fingers, Jenkins sewed in the last gaudy bits of golden thread and hemmed the robe. </p><p> "You could wear it in the street, Master Will, and have the commonality bow and scrape before you as if in sooth you were a great lord," he said, chuckling. </p><p> "I could wear it in the street and be seized and flung in the Counter for dressing above my station," Shakespeare retorted. "'Tis a thing forbidden actors, save when on the stage." Jenkins only chuckled again; he knew that perfectly well. </p><p> He was finished almost as soon as he'd promised, and held up the robe to Shakespeare as if he were the tireman about to dress him in it. "You did but jest as to the scot, I am sure," he said. </p><p> "'Steeth, Master Jenkins, I did not. Is mine own time a worthless thing, that I should spend it freely for the sake of your broken promise?" </p><p> "Broken it was not, for I promised the robe today, and here it is." </p><p> "And had I come at eventide, and not of the morning? You had been forsworn then. You may have mended your promise, but that means not it was unbroken." </p><p> They argued a while longer, more or less good-naturedly. At last, the tailor took five shillings off the price he'd set before. "More than you deserve, but for the sake of your future custom I shall do't," he told Shakespeare. "Which still leaves you owing fourteen pounds, five shillings, sixpence." </p><p> "The stuffs you use are dear indeed," Shakespeare grumbled as he gave Jenkins the money. Some of the silver and copper coins he set on the counter bore the images of Isabella and Albert, others-the older, more worn, ones-that of the deposed Elizabeth, who still languished in the Tower of London, only a furlong or so from where Shakespeare stood. He looked outside. It was still drizzling. "Can you give me somewhat wherewith to cover this robe, Master Jenkins? I am not fain to have the weeping heavens smirch it." </p><p> "I believe I may. Let me see." Jenkins rummaged under the counter and came up with a piece of coarse canvas that had seen better days. "Here, will this serve?" At Shakespeare's brusque nod, the tailor wrapped the cloth around the robe and tied it with some twine. He bobbed his head to Shakespeare as he passed him the bundle. "Here you are, Master Will, and I am sorry for the inconvenience I put you to." </p><p> Shakespeare sighed. "No help for it. Now I needs must-" Horns blared and drums thudded out in the street. He jumped. "What's that?" </p><p> "Did you not recall?" The tailor's face twisted. "By decree of the Spaniards, 'tis the day of the great auto de fe." </p><p> "Oh, a pox! You are right, and it had gone out of my head altogether." Shakespeare looked out into the street as horn calls and drums came again. In response to that music, people swarmed from all directions to gape at the spectacle. </p><p> "A lucky man, who can forget the inquisitors," Jenkins said. "A month gone by, as is their custom, they came down Tower Street making proclamation that this . . . ceremony would be held." He might have been about to offer some comment on the auto de fe, but he didn't. Shakespeare couldn't blame him for watching his tongue. In London these days, a word that reached the wrong ears could mean disaster for a man. </p><p> He felt disaster of a different, smaller, sort brushing against him. "In this swarm of mankind, I shall be an age making my way back to my lodgings." </p><p> "Why not go with the parade to Tower Hill and see what's to be seen?" Jenkins said. "After all, when in Rome . . . and we are all Romans now, is't not so?" He chuckled once more. </p><p> So did Shakespeare, sourly. "How could it be otherwise?" he returned. In Elizabeth's day, Catholic recusants had had to pay a fine for refusing to attend Protestant services. Now, with their Catholic Majesties ruling England, with the Inquisition and the Jesuits zealously bringing the country back under the dominion of the Pope, not going to Mass could and often did mean worse than fines. Like most people, Shakespeare conformed, as he'd conformed under Elizabeth. Some folk went to church simply because it was the safe thing to do; some, after nine years and more of Catholic rule, because they'd come to believe. But almost everyone did go. </p><p> "Why not what?" Jenkins repeated. "Think what you will of the dons and the monks, but they do make a brave show. Mayhap you'll spy some bit of business you can filch for one of your dramas." </p><p> Shakespeare had thought nothing could make him want to watch an auto de fe. Now he discovered he was wrong. He nodded to the tailor. "I thank you, Master Jenkins. I had not thought of that. Perhaps I shall." He tucked the robe under his arm, settled his hat more firmly on his head, and went out into Tower Street. </p><p> Spanish soldiers-and some blond-bearded Englishmen loyal to Isabella and Albert-in helmets and corselets held pikes horizontally in front of their bodies to keep back the crowd and let the procession move toward Tower Hill. They looked as if they would use those spears, and the swords hanging from their belts, at the slightest excuse. Perhaps because of that, no one gave them any such excuse. </p><p> Two or three rows of people stood in front of Shakespeare, but he had no trouble seeing over any of them save one woman whose steeple-crowned hat came up to the level of his eyes. He looked east, toward the church of St. Margaret in Pattens' Lane, from which the procession was coming. At its head strode the trumpeters and drummers, who blasted out another fanfare even as he turned to look at them. </p><p> More grim-faced soldiers marched at their heels: again, Spaniards and Englishmen mixed. Some bore pikes. Others carried arquebuses or longer, heavier muskets. Tiny wisps of smoke rose from the lengths of slow match the men with firearms bore to discharge their pieces. The drizzle had almost stopped while Shakespeare waited for the tailor to finish the robe. In wetter weather, the matchlocks would have been useless as anything but clubs. As they marched, they talked with one another in an argot that had grown up since the Armada's men came ashore, with Spanish lisps and trills mingling with the slow sonorities of English. </p><p> Behind the soldiers tramped a hundred woodmongers in the gaudy livery of their company. <i>One of those robes would do as well to play the king in as that which I have here</i>, Shakespeare thought. But the woodmongers, whose goods would feed the fires that burned heretics today, seemed to be playing soldiers themselves: like the armored men ahead of them, they too marched with arquebuses and pikes. </p><p> From a second-story window across the street from Shakespeare, a woman shouted, "Shame on you, Jack Scrope!" One of the woodmongers carrying a pike whipped his head around to see who had cried out, but no faces showed at that window. A dull flush stained the fellow's cheeks as he strode on. </p><p> Next came a party of black-robed Dominican friars-mostly Spaniards, by their looks-before whom a white cross was carried. They chanted psalms in Latin as they paraded up Tower Street. </p><p> After them marched Charles Neville, the Earl of Westmorland, the Protector of the English Inquisition. The northerner's face was hard and closed and proud. He had risen against Elizabeth a generation before, spent years in exile in the Netherlands, and surely relished every chance he got for revenge against the Protestants. The old man carried the standard of the Inquisition, and held it high. </p><p> For a moment, Shakespeare's gaze swung to the left, to the gray bulk of the Tower, though the church of Allhallows Barking hid part of the fortress from view. He wondered if, from one of those towers, Elizabeth were watching the auto de fe. What would the imprisoned Queen be thinking if she were? Did she thank King Philip for sparing her life after the Duke of Parma's professional soldiers swept aside her English levies? "Though she herself slew a queen, I shall not stoop to do likewise," Philip had said. Was that generosity? Or did Elizabeth, with all she'd labored so long to build torn to pieces around her, reckon her confinement more like hell on earth? </p><p> <i>'Twould make a splendid tragedy, Shakespeare thought, were setting so little as a single line of't to paper not worth my life-and a hard, cruel death I'd have, too.</i> Written or not, though, those scenes began to shape themselves in his mind. He shook his head like a fly-bedeviled horse, trying to clear it. </p><p> More than a little to his relief, a murmur in the crowd brought his attention back to the parade. Behind the Protector of the Inquisition stalked Robert Parsons, the Archbishop of Canterbury. His cold, thin features made Neville's look genial. He'd spent a generation in exile, struggling from afar against English Protestantism. </p><p> After the prelate marched another company of guardsmen. These were wild Irishmen, brought over to help the Spaniards hold England down. Most spoke only Irish; the few who used some English had brogues so thick, it was hard to tell from the other tongue. </p><p> The crowd stirred and buzzed. A couple of men pointed. A woman exclaimed. <i>After the sallet comes the main course</i>, Shakespeare thought. A couple of dozen men exhibited life-sized pasteboard images of those convicted by the Inquisition who had either died in gaol or had escaped its clutches and were being outlawed. More servitors carried trunks that bore the bones of the former. The sides and tops of the trunks were painted with hellfire's flames. </p><p> Then came the prisoners themselves. First was a group of about a dozen men and women with conical pasteboard caps fully a yard high on their heads. Most of the caps had HERETIC written on them in large letters in English and Latin. One said ALCHEMIST, another SODOMITE. In the first years after the triumph of the Duke of Parma's men, Shakespeare remembered, the words had been written in Spanish as well. These days, though, the English Inquisition operated on its own, with little help from its former teachers. Each of the condemned had a rope around his neck and carried a torch in his right hand. </p><p> More prisoners, also carrying torches, followed the first lot. They wore sanbenitos-coarse yellow penitential tunics without sleeves-with the cross of St. Andrew painted on the back in red.

She tries not to think about her mother&#x2019;s suicide (her last words to Lena were a forbidden &#x201c;I love you&#x201d;) or the supposed &#x201c;Invalid&#x201d; community made up of the uncured just beyond her Portland, Maine, border.

In this powerful and beautifully written novel, Lauren Oliver, the bestselling author of <em>Before I Fall</em>, throws readers into a tightly controlled society where options don&#x2019;t exist, and shows not only the lengths one will go for a chance at freedom, but also the true meaning of sacrifice. --<em>Jessica Schein<br><br></em> <strong><br>Lauren Oliver&#x2019;s <em>Delirium</em> Playlist </strong> <br> <p>In <em>Delirium</em>, the government requires that all teenagers be cured of love, a.k.a. deliria, to keep society safe.

She lives in Brooklyn with her husband and children. She is the author of <em>Where She Went</em> and <em>If I Stay</em>. Recently she sat down with Lauren Oliver to discuss their work. Read the resulting interview below, or turn the tables to see what happened when Lauren interviewed Gayle.</p> <p><em>From Gayle Forman</em>: Lauren Oliver is kind of mind-blowing. She wrote her intensely moving debut, Before I Fall when she was 26, which seems impossible given the book&#x2019;s depth and wisdom. She followed up with the deliciously provocative love story <em>Delirium</em>, the first of a trilogy, and her first middle-grade book, <em>Liesl &amp; Po</em> comes out in the fall of 2011. On top of that, she&#x2019;s constantly cooking up book ideas for her literary development company. Somehow, she managed to slow down long enough for us to talk shop over lunch in our mutual hometown, Brooklyn.</p> <p><strong>Gayle:</strong> You have like 100 balls in the air. Are you one of those people who thrives on an insane amount of activity?</p> <p><strong>Lauren:</strong> I&#x2019;ve been busy and overextended my whole life. I wrote half of <em>Before I Fall</em> while I had a full-time job, was a full-time grad student, and worked part-time in a nightclub. I wrote the first half of the book on my phone on the subway. I&#x2019;d email the chapters to myself.</p> <p><strong>Gayle:</strong> You wrote the book on your phone?</p> <p><strong>Lauren:</strong> It&#x2019;s very rare that I write on my computer. A lot of times I&#x2019;m writing on subways or in the back of cabs or on airplanes. I know the exact quantity of lines on my BlackBerry and how it relates to word count.</p> <p><strong>Gayle:</strong> Well, that brings me right to my question about process. How does an idea become a book for you? How did <em>Delirium</em> arrive?</p> <p><strong>Lauren:</strong> I&#x2019;d read an essay by Gabriel Garcia Marquez that said that all great books are either about death or love and I&#x2019;d already written about death. And I started thinking that I&#x2019;d never written a love story. It was out of my comfort zone. The next day I was at the gym, and the TV was on and the news report was all about the swine flu epidemic. It was the latest in the flu scares. And I thought it was so weird how easily people become panicked. You can convince people that anything is an epidemic. So much is propaganda. And the two ideas just combined in my head. And the character of Lena started narrating immediately.</p> <p><strong>Gayle:</strong> Moral of the story, budding writers: Go to the gym.</p> <p><strong>Lauren:</strong> Most of my breakthrough ideas come at the gym or while showering.</p> <p><strong>Gayle:</strong> Me too! And I&#x2019;ll run out and start writing and be dripping in a towel.</p> <p><strong>Lauren:</strong> I&#x2019;ve actually ruined computers that way. I think what happens is punctuated equilibrium: a period when changes are accumulating but not visibly, the simmering is happening. Then, when your mind is very relaxed, what was unconscious becomes conscious.</p> <p><strong>Gayle:</strong> On the surface, there&#x2019;s a very big leap between your first two books. <em>Before I Fall</em> follows Sam, a prototypical mean girl who has to relive the last day of her life while <em>Delirium</em> follows Lena who lives in a creepy world in which love has been outlawed. But really, both of these girls start out conformists and challenge the constraints on their lives.</p> <p><strong>Lauren:</strong> Transformation is very important to me. I definitely am very interested in how people become who they are. In change. In characters who are damaged who and who feel initially unlovable&#x2014;and in their redemption through feelings of love.</p> <p><strong>Gayle:</strong> Who are you more like, Lena or Sam?</p> <p><strong>Lauren:</strong> Sam is more similar to how I was in high school. I was rebellious. I went out and partied and did all the bad things that she did. Lena is just... she&#x2019;s so obedient and so scared of doing anything wrong. I was so fond of her. I kind of loved her in this way, I felt so protective of her. She&#x2019;s so fragile and also brave.</p> <p><strong>Gayle:</strong> That was exactly how I felt about Mia in <em>If I Stay</em>. I loved the strength of both Sam and Lena, in relation to their love interests. Even in <em>Delirium</em>, where Alex is the one who sparks Lena&#x2019;s rebellion, she&#x2019;s no damsel in distress.</p> <p><strong>Lauren:</strong> I don&#x2019;t believe in damsels. That&#x2019;s not a model of femininity or heroism I subscribe to. Everyone has to learn to save themselves. It can be through the mechanisms of loving other people but you have to learn to save yourself.</p> <p><strong>Gayle:</strong> Dystopian fiction is very hot right now. Did you have any idea you&#x2019;d be on the cutting edge of this trend?</p> <p><strong>Lauren:</strong> I never heard that word when I wrote <em>Delirium</em>. I mean, I knew what it meant but not as a category. <em>Delirium</em> is supposed to be a meditation on love, what it does, good and bad. Because there have been times when if I could have reached inside to take out my own heart out, I would&#x2019;ve. Books can&#x2019;t come from categories; they come from a desire to say something about the world.</p> <p></p><p>Lauren Oliver's short stories about Hana, Annabel, and Raven&#x2014; riveting characters from the bestselling Delirium series&#x2014; are collected here in print for the first time.</p><p>The three short stories in this collection expand and enrich the Delirium world, illuminating events and characters through new perspectives.</p><p>Hana adds nuance to the life-changing summer before best friends Lena and Hana are to be cured&#x2014;a moment when the girls' paths diverge and their futures are altered forever.</p><p>Annabel untangles the mysteries surrounding Lena's mother, detailing her journey from teenage runaway to prisoner of the state.</p><p>And Raven crackles with the intensity of its title character, the fierce leader of a rebel group in the Wilds who plays an integral role in the resistance.</p><p>This thrilling collection also includes an excerpt from <em>Requiem</em>, the final novel in Lauren Oliver's <em>New York Times</em> bestselling series.</p></p><h2>The Hours of Henry VIII: A Renaissance Masterpiece by Jean Poyet</h2><p>A product for the royal court of France, The Hours of Henry VIII created around 1500 by Jean Poyet, is one of the most splendid Books of Hours from this period. This magnificently illustrated lay book of daily devotions and prayers contains fifty-seven exquisitely hand-painted images all reproduced here together and in colour for the first time. The previously little-known Poyet (active c.1483-1503) enjoyed patronage at the courts of three French Kings. Not only an illuminator of manuscripts of the highest quality, Poyet also created panel paintings, elaborate drawings, and designed theatrical spectacles, all in a style that links Fouquet to Poussin. Author Roger S. Wieck provides a thorough examination of the importance both of this grand manuscript within its art historical context and of Poyet&#39;s artistic achievements, which fluidly merged the cool, late Gothic aesthetic of his native northern France with the avant-garde Renaissance style of northern Italy. All known works by Poyet are discussed and illustrated. The volume is enriched with detailed commentaries by William M. Voelkle and K. Michelle Hearne on each section of the Book of Hours and an analysis of the fascinating history of the manuscript (tradition holds that it was once in the collection of Henry VIII, hence its name today).</p><p>Roger S. Wieck is Curator of Medieval and Renaissance Manuscripts at the Morgan Library, New York. He is the author of Painted Prayers: The Book of Hours in Medieval and Renaissance Art and Time Scantified: The Book of Hours in Medieval Art and Life. William M. Voelkle is Curator and Head of the Medieval and Renaissance Manuscripts Department at the Morgan Library, New York. K. Michelle Hearne is a Curatorial Assistant in the Department of Medieval and Renaissance Manuscripts at the Morgan Library.A Book of Hours was a medieval collection of scriptural lessons and prayers for lay readers and a kind of religious day planner for the rich. Pierpont Morgan Library curators Wieck and William M. Voelkle and curatorial assistant K. Michelle Hearne have collaborated here to examine the Hours of Henry VIII, created around 1500 by French illuminator Jean Poyet. This study briefly explores the history of the Books of Hours and of the artists, who were much in demand to produce these works, as well as their imitators. The writing is conversational and interesting, though the lack of an index limits the book's research value. The bulk of the book consists of color plates and accompanying commentary. Handsomely drawn, the illustrations show each delicate brush stroke. One appendix details the physical arrangement of the Hours of Henry VIII; another examines the possible ownership and history of the Hours.

The century that followed was an era of vigorous expansion and large-scale projects, of rapidly changing culture and commerce, as huge numbers of people arrived in the shining city, drawn by its immense wealth and power and its many diversions. Borrowing a phrase from Daniel Defoe, Jerry White calls London &#x201c;this great and monstrous thing,&#x201d; the grandeur of its new buildings and the glitter of its high life shadowed by poverty and squalor.</p><p> </p><p> <i>A Great and Monstrous Thing</i> offers a street-level view of the city: its public gardens and prisons, its banks and brothels, its workshops and warehouses&#x2014;and its bustling, jostling crowds. White introduces us to shopkeepers and prostitutes, men and women of fashion and genius, street-robbers and thief-takers, as they play out the astonishing drama of life in eighteenth-century London. What emerges is a picture of a society fractured by geography, politics, religion, history&#x2014;and especially by class, for the divide between rich and poor in London was never greater or more destructive in the modern era than in these years.</p><p> </p><p> Despite this gulf, Jerry White shows us Londoners going about their business as bankers or beggars, reveling in an enlarging world of public pleasures, indulging in crimes both great and small&#x2014;amidst the tightening sinews of power and regulation, and the hesitant beginnings of London democracy.</p></p><p>Jerry White is Visiting Professor in History at Birkbeck, University of London.[A] magisterial history of London... The book hums with vitality...a gripping story. (Norma Clarke <i>Times Literary Supplement</i>)<br><br>[A] brilliant account of the bursting, overflowing city, with its glittering wealth and harrowing poverty. (<i>The Financial Times</i>)<br><br>Together with Iain Sinclair and Peter Ackroyd, White is one of our great chroniclers of London and this beautifully written, impeccably researched and incredibly generous book is a necessity for those of us who are not yet tired of life. (Frances Wilson <i>The Telegraph</i>)<br><br>Enormously learned and entertaining...We get the great and the mighty, architects and anarchists, Jewish moneylenders and Old Bailey workhorses, foppish aristocrats and beggar-parents who blind their own children to increase their chances at pity-alms. We're toured through wonders and depravities so energetic it's almost as though the whole era could somehow feel the Victorian corset of modernity waiting to tighten everything up into the rough shape of the world we know today...It's largely through the torrential scribblings of those hackney writers that we have such a vivid portrait of 18th century London, and it's by through consulting such an ungodly amount of those scribblings that <b>White</b> is able to give his readers such a lively and detailed account...Prepare to be instructed, amazed, and most of all amused. This is popular history done on a lavish, irresistible scale...History buffs shouldn't miss it--and 21st century Londoners will find themselves eerily at home. (Steve Donoghue <i>Open Letters Monthly</i> 2013-02-28)<br><br>If you want a rounded and immensely detailed picture of the 'Hogarthian' world, this is the place to go...Scholars will make <i>A Great and Monstrous Thing</i> their first port of call, and anyone with the faintest interest in bygone London will be able to access an immense trove of thick description here. (Pat Rogers <i>New Criterion</i> 2013-06-01)<br><br>Great urban historians can make the streets a sensory playground. In the best works, like <b>Jerry White</b>'s <i>A Great and Monstrous Thing</i>, the sounds clamor and peal, the smells overwhelm and sicken, the sights tantalize and repulse in equal measure. To read this book is to literally live the mucky, yucky, fascinating, wonderful kaleidoscopic life of eighteenth century London. White's work isn't just great and monstrous, but engagingly organized as well. He takes one of London's most volatile and complex periods, one of the high points of its cultural development, and terrifically frames it. Like the city itself, the book is divided into subsections of city, people, work, culture, and power. Names like Johnson, Haywood, and Fielding abound, yes, but it's so much more. It wasn't just the high and mighty or the downtrodden that would be so faithfully recorded by Dickens a century later. White saw the city honestly, and recorded a narrative, which honored, if not outright enjoyed, its complexities. (Josh Zajdman <i>Bookslut</i> 2013-03-01)<br><br>In addition to its appeal to the average interested reader, <b>White</b>'s book will prove to be an invaluable resource to future academics. This work is as close to pure history as a book can be...<i> A Great and Monstrous Thing </i>will likely serve its audience for generations to come. (Jennifer Vega <i>PopMatters</i> 2013-02-15)<br><br>The titular superlative, courtesy of Daniel Defoe, aptly fits this engrossing history of the city that by 1700 had surpassed Paris to become the largest in Europe...<b>White</b>'s encyclopedic knowledge may, like bustling London, overwhelm some, but this is still a richly satisfying compendium of history, biography, anecdote, and statistics on the great city's daily life, vibrant culture, and byzantine politics. (<i>Publishers Weekly</i> 2012-12-03)<br><br><p>With this volume, <b>White</b> completes an extraordinary trilogy begun with <i>London in the Nineteenth Century</i> (2007) and <i>London in the Twentieth Century</i> (2001). As in the earlier books, he addresses five broad topics: city, people, work, culture, and power. Differently here, he uses brief biographies of 14 representative figures--such as architect James</p><p> Woods, impresario Teresa Cornelys, philanthropist Jonas Hanway, and radical John Wilkes--to begin thematic essays involving scores of Londoners. The variety is striking: from the desperate poor in alley and workhouse to the rich and often well-born patrons of Exchange, gaming table, and brothel; from the many victims of Tyburn to the 'hanging classes' of magistrate's bench and beyond; from Wilkite pressure for political justice to sectarian madness in the Gordon Riots...The narrative is superb and richly informed, incisively and sympathetically evoking the city Defoe had thought a 'great and monstrous thing.'</p> (G.

The riveting and critically acclaimed bestseller, soon to be a major motion picture directed by Ron Howard Chris Hemsworth, Cillian Murphy, Ben Whishaw, and Brendan Gleeson will star in a new film based on this National Book Award-winning account of the true events behind Moby Dick. In 1820, the whaleship Essex was rammed and sunk by an angry sperm whale, leaving the desperate crew to drift for more than ninety days in three tiny boats. Nathaniel Philbrick uses little-known documents and vivid details about the Nantucket whaling tradition to reveal the chilling facts of this infamous maritime disaster. In the Heart of the Sea--and now, its epic adaptation for the screen--will forever place the Essex tragedy in the American historical canon.</p><p>The appeal of Dava Sobel's <i>Longitude</i> was, in part, that it illuminated a little-known piece of history through a series of captivating incidents and engaging personalities. Nathaniel Philbrick's <i>In the Heart of the Sea</i> is certainly cast from the same mold, examining the 19th-century Pacific whaling industry through the arc of the sinking of the whaleship <i>Essex</i> by a boisterous sperm whale. The story that inspired Herman Melville's classic <i>Moby-Dick</i> has a lot going for it--derring-do, cannibalism, rescue--and Philbrick proves an amiable and well-informed narrator, providing both context and detail. We learn about the importance and mechanics of blubber production--a vital source of oil--and we get the nuts and bolts of harpooning and life aboard whalers. We are spared neither the nitty-gritty of open boats nor the sucking of human bones dry.<p> By sticking to the tried and tested <i>Longitude</i> formula, Philbrick has missed a slight trick or two. The epicenter of the whaling industry was Nantucket, a small island off Cape Cod; most of the whales were in the Pacific, necessitating a huge journey around the southernmost tip of South America. We never learn why no one ever tried to create an alternative whaling capital somewhere nearer. Similarly, Philbrick tells us that the story of the <i>Essex</i> was well known to Americans for decades, but he never explores how such legends fade from our consciousness. Philbrick would no doubt reply that such questions were beyond his remit, and you can't exactly accuse him of skimping on his research. By any standard, 50 pages of footnotes impress, though he wears his learning lightly. He doesn't get bogged down in turgid detail, and his narrative rattles along at a nice pace. When the storyline is as good as this, you can't really ask for more. <i>--John Crace, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>7 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Tying Dry Flies: The Complete Dry Fly Instruction and Pattern Manual</h2><p>Though not always easy, of the many fly fishing methods, dry-fly fishing is the easiest.

Blood Rites takes us on an original journey from the elaborate human sacrifices of the ancient world to the carnage and holocaust of twentieth-century "total war." Sifting through the fragile records of prehistory, Ehrenreich discovers the wellspring of war in an unexpected place--not in a "killer instinct" unique to the males of our species but in the blood rites early humans performed to reenact their terrifying experience of predation by stronger carnivores. Brilliant in conception, rich in scope, Blood Rites is a monumental work that will transform our understanding of the greatest single threat to human life.</p></p><p>In this ambitious work, Barbara Ehrenreich offers a daring explanation for humans' propensity to wage war. Rather than approach the subject from a physiological perspective, pinpointing instinct or innate aggressiveness as the violent culprit, she reaches back to primitive man's fear of predators and the anxieties associated with life in the food chain. To deal with the reality of living as prey, she argues that blood rites were created to dramatize and validate the life-and-death struggle. Jumping ahead to the modern age, Ehrenreich brands nationalism a more sophisticated form of blood ritual, a phenomenon that conjures similar fears of predation, whether in the form of lost territory or the more extreme ethnic cleansing. <i>Blood Rites: Origins and History of the Passions of War</i> may not offer a cure for human aggression, but the author does present a convincing argument for the difficulties associated with achieving peace.<p><b>Barbara Ehrenreich</b> is the bestselling author of <i>Nickel and Dimed</i>, <i>Bait and Switch</i>, <i>Bright-sided</i>, <i>This Land Is Their Land</i>, and <i>Dancing in the Streets</i>, among others. A frequent contributor to <i>Harper's</i> and <i>The Nation</i>, she has also been a columnist at <i>The New York Times</i> and <i>Time</i> magazine. She is the winner of the <i>L.A. Times</i> Book Prize for Current Interest and ALA Notable Books for Nonfiction. </p><p>Ehrenreich was born in Butte, Montana, when it was still a bustling mining town. She studied physics at Reed College, and earned a Ph.D. in cell biology from Rockefeller University. Rather than going into laboratory work, she got involved in activism, and soon devoted herself to writing her innovative journalism.

His three freedmen, Narcissus, Pallas, and Callistus, must find a way to manufacture a quick victory for Claudius&#x2014;but how? Pallas has the answer: retrieve the Eagle of the Seventeenth, lost in Germania nearly 40 years before. Who but Vespasian could lead a dangerous mission into the gloomy forests of Germania?

Then early one winter morning, for no earthly reason, she wandered into a church. &#x201c;I was certainly not interested in becoming a Christian,&#x201d; she writes, &#x201c;or, as I thought of it rather less politely, a religious nut.&#x201d; But she ate a piece of bread, took a sip of wine, and found herself radically transformed.<br><br>The mysterious sacrament of communion has sustained Miles ever since, in a faith she&#x2019;d scorned, in work she&#x2019;d never imagined. In this astonishing story, she tells how the seeds of her conversion were sown, and what her life has been like since she took that bread. <br><br>A lesbian left-wing journalist who covered revolutions around the world, Miles was not the woman her friends expected to see suddenly praising Jesus. She was certainly not the kind of person the government had in mind to run a &#x201c;faith-based charity.&#x201d; Religion for her was not about angels or good behavior or piety; it was about real hunger, real food, and real bodies. Before long, she turned the bread she ate at communion into tons of groceries, piled on the church&#x2019;s altar to be given away. The first food pantry she established provided hundreds of poor, elderly, sick, deranged, and marginalized people with lifesaving food and a sense of belonging. Within a few years, the loaves had multiplied, and she and the people she served had started nearly a dozen more pantries.<br><br>Take This Bread is rich with real-life Dickensian characters&#x2013;church ladies, child abusers, millionaires, schizophrenics, bishops, and thieves&#x2013;all blown into Miles&#x2019;s life by the relentless force of her newfound calling. She recounts stories about trudging through the rain in housing projects, wiping the runny nose of a psychotic man, storing a battered woman&#x2019;s .375 Magnum in a cookie tin. She writes about the economy of hunger and the ugly politics of food; the meaning of prayer and the physicality of faith. Here, in this achingly beautiful, passionate book, is the living communion of Christ.<br>&#x201c;The most amazing book.&#x201d; &#x2013; Anne Lamott</p><p>Sara Miles is the author of How to Hack a Party Line: The Democrats and Silicon Valley and co-editor of Directed by Desire: The Collected Poems of June Jordan and the anthology Opposite Sex: Gay Men on Lesbians, Lesbians on Gay Men.

Now I understand that questions are at the heart of faith, and that certainties about God can flicker on and off, no matter what you think you know. But back then I thought &#x201c;believers&#x201d; were people who knew exactly what they believed, and had nailed all the answers. <br><br>My first set of questions was very basic. I covertly studied the faces of people at St. Gregory&#x2019;s when they took the bread, trying to guess what they were feeling, but I was too proud and too timid to ask either priests or congregants the beginner&#x2019;s queries: Why do you cross yourselves? What are the candles for? How do you pray? And, more seriously: do you really believe this stuff? <br><br>My next question was not about God or church: it was nakedly about me, and my fears. What would my friends think? <br><br>In America I knew exactly one person who was a Christian. It turned out that my friend Mark Pritchard, an introverted writer with a tongue piercing, attended a Lutheran church with wooden pews where he sang old-fashioned hymns every Sunday. So I took some walks with Mark, trying to draw him out, but despite his orange Mohawk and wild sexual politics, he was a fairly Lutheran guy, not much given to discussing his emotions or spiritual life. &#x201c;Sure, well, I believe in first principles,&#x201d; Mark said to me, cautiously, when I probed him about his beliefs. He might as well have been speaking Greek. &#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; I said. I didn&#x2019;t know anyone else who went to church. <br><br>Poor people certainly believed in God. San Francisco might be the least church-going city in the nation, but there were still plenty of churches within the run-down blocks around my house &#x2013;the left-wing Chicano Catholic parish with its gorgeous altar to the Virgin of Guadalupe; the &#x201c;Temple of the Lyre of the Valley,&#x201d; an evangelical Salvadoran storefront; the black Pentecostal dive, the santeria chapel, the cruddy white-trash Assembly of God building with its dirty curtains. Poor people said &#x201c;God bless you&#x201d; and crossed themselves and stood on street corners singing loud, bad hymns; they bought their little girls frothy First Communion dresses; they buried their dead gangbanger brothers with incense and Scripture.<br><br>Nationally, middle-class Christians &#x2013;even though many seemed to enjoy portraying themselves as a picked-on, oppressed minority, ceaselessly battling secular humanist regimes &#x2013;weren&#x2019;t exactly an endangered species, either. People who called themselves Christians comprised 85% of the population. Christian rock music alone was a billion-dollar a year enterprise; there were more than a hundred and fifty million Christian Web sites, and there had never been a non-Christian United States president. <br><br>But my own friends weren&#x2019;t poor urban believers or smug God-talking suburbanites. My own friends, at the most, read about Buddhism or practiced yoga. They tended to be cynical, hilarious, and over-educated, with years of therapy and contemporary literature behind them, and I was afraid to mention that I was slipping off to church and singing about Jesus on Sundays instead of sleeping late, cooking brunch, and reading the New York Times Book Review as I&#x2019;d been raised to do. I couldn&#x2019;t tell them about communion, or that I had started to read the Bible I&#x2019;d bought, furtively, at a used-book store. It would be years before I&#x2019;d meet Paul Fromberg&#x2014;&#x2014;a funny, profane priest who would become my closest friend. He believed that &#x201c;the craziest thing about Jesus is that church life never gets in the way of feeling close to him,&#x201d; and would teach me about the ironies of religion. At the time, though, I had no idea that I could be pals with anyone who described himself, unabashedly, as both &#x201c;a big fag&#x201d; and &#x201c;Jesus&#x2019; man.&#x201d; <br><br>My social circle was shocked when I first shyly broached the subject of church. An activist lawyer I knew sputtered. &#x201c;Are you kidding?&#x201d; he said. He launched a litany of complaints about the Church that I&#x2019;d come to hear over and over: it was the most reactionary force in the world, anti-Semitic, misogynist, homophobic....the Vatican...the Crusades...Jerry Falwell...child-molesting priests...Ralph Reed... I&#x2019;d hated, during the 1980s, being expected to defend left movements or revolutionary parties, even when they were screwed up. I had no interest in defending another more fabulously corrupt institution. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not about the Church,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s about<i>..</i>.&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;Good deeds?&#x201d; the lawyer asked, incredulously. My desire for religion just didn&#x2019;t make sense to him. He worked harder than anyone I&#x2019;d ever met, spending fourteen hours a day defending Haitian refugees and Muslim political detainees and the victims of war and empire. He&#x2019;d listened to prisoners on Guant�namo sob as they described Christian jailers destroying the Koran; he had represented a Nicaraguan woman raped by evangelical soldiers who sang hymns as they took turns with her on a dirt floor. Whatever faith drove him forward in his vocation, it had nothing to do with the Almighty God so readily invoked at prayer breakfasts in Washington.<br><br>But the Christianity that called to me, through the stories I read in the Bible, scattered the proud and rebuked the powerful. It was a religion in which divinity was revealed by scars on flesh. It was an upside-down world in which treasure, as the prophet said, was found in darkness; the hungry were filled with good things and the rich sent out empty; in which new life was revealed through a humiliated, hungry woman and an empty, tortured man.<br> <br>It was a picture that my friend Jose Suarez, who&#x2019;d left his Cuban Baptist family in Texas to become a psychiatrist, had also glimpsed&#x2014;&#x2014;but only briefly. Devout as a child, saved as a teenager at a Billy Graham rally, Jose made it through a year at a conservative Christian college before he began to feel &#x201c;betrayed&#x201d; by the inauthenticity of religion. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d go to services,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;and it was all very social, unexamined, class-bound. I mean, didn&#x2019;t they read the words of Jesus?&#x201d; <br><br>But the hypocrisy and insincerity of church, what had driven my own parents away, was only part of it. &#x201c;I was actively listening,&#x201d; Jose said. &#x201c;I really wanted to hear God. Ping�� &#x2013;nothing. Ping&#x2013;nothing. I couldn&#x2019;t find it. I&#x2019;d drive out this highway into the country at night, lie back on the hood of my car and look at the stars, and have these arguments with God. It was like: say something, show me, give me a sign, some sort of experience. I&#x2019;d watch the stars move across the sky, but I couldn&#x2019;t find it inside. The container didn&#x2019;t contain anymore.&#x201d;<br><br>And so Jose had been wary, though curious, when I told him I was going to church: I was the first friend he&#x2019;d had since high school who was anything close to a believer. It was talking with him that I was able to articulate, for the first time, something about what prayer meant to me: what I was searching for, beyond the psychological, with all my questions about faith.<br><br>Jose and I met for lunch at a small caf� with outdoor tables one afternoon, when he was in the middle of an excruciating breakup. We sat on the patio and talked, picking at some complicated California sourdough-and-vegetable sandwiches while the fog came in. <br><br>Jose was in analysis then, and seeing a dozen patients, and serving as the medical director at a community mental health clinic, and writing scholarly papers on Freud, and doing energetic yoga for hours every morning, and generally overachieving, but he couldn&#x2019;t fill every minute, and whenever he paused, the heartbreak would pour in. &#x201c;Maybe I should go sit at the Zen center again,&#x201d; Jose said. He was a small, handsome man with wiry hair and little glasses and perfect posture. His eyes were wet. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sleeping so well anyway, I might as well get up at five, what the hell.&#x201d; <br><br>We finished lunch and I took his hand. &#x201c;Jose,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;you should pray.&#x201d;<br><br>As soon as I said it I felt like an idiot &#x2013;worse, like a proselytizing busybody who knows, without ambiguity, what&#x2019;s right for everyone else. Jose looked genuinely surprised. Then he put on his analyst face. &#x201c;Hmm,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;What do you mean?&#x201d;<br><br>What did I mean by prayer? I didn&#x2019;t mean asking an omnipotent being to do favors; the idea of &#x201c;answered prayers&#x201d; was untenable for me, since millions of people prayed fervently for things they never received. I didn&#x2019;t mean reciting a formula: I loved the language of some of the old prayers that were chanted at St. Gregory&#x2019;s, but I didn&#x2019;t think the words had magical power to change things. I didn&#x2019;t mean kneeling and looking pious, or trying to make a deal with God, or even praying &#x201c;for&#x201d; something. What was I telling him?<br><br>&#x201c;Um, well,&#x201d; I said. I was embarrassed. Then I looked at Jose again, and the word &#x201c;tender&#x201d; filled my mind &#x2013;tender as in sore to the touch and compassionate, at the same time. After my father had died, Jose had listened to me cry with the deepest empathy and patience, not trying to &#x201c;comfort&#x201d; me, but just being present. As tenderly as I could, I said to him, &#x201c;I really don&#x2019;t know. I don&#x2019;t know what I believe, or who I&#x2019;m talking to. Sometimes I just try to stay open, sort of. Especially when it hurts. And I try to, I know this is corny, but I try to summon up thankfulness.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;When you told me to pray,&#x201d; Jose would remember later, &#x201c;it was incredibly earnest. You said prayer was like having this intense, profound longing that you just had to be with. That you put the longing in the ...</p><h2>Joshua Tree National Park (Rookie National Parks)</h2><p><b>Young readers will love exploring the rocks, boulders, and otherworldly trees that make Joshua Tree National Park so special.</b><br><br>Follow Ranger Rick as he gives the youngest reader (Ages 6-7) a fun and fascinating tour of some of the most spectacular places in the United States.

With over 1,200 facilitators in more than 50 countries, <i>The Passion Test</i> has become the #1 tool used worldwide to help people discover their passions and connect with purpose.

The Attwoods were supported in creating <i>Your Hidden Riches</i> by Dr. Sylva Dvorak. Dr. Sylva&#x2019;s rich background in the science and practice of ritual along with her degree in Psychoneurology and Integrative Healing helped provide the depth and breadth of this powerful book.A VISION OF FULFILLMENT<br><br>Rituals are tools to access your hidden riches. They can take you to the heart of your problems as well as to the heart of their solutions. This may be a new message for many of you, yet one of the purposes rituals have served for centuries is healing. They also served as the sacred connection to a higher reality. Why should you take such a journey yourself?<br><br>Rituals are all about reconnecting. When mind, body, and spirit are truly connected,<br><br>You feel more energetic.<br><br>You feel centered and powerful.<br><br>You are in the flow.<br><br>You emanate a glow, inside and out.<br><br>When you are connected, your life energy doesn&#x2019;t flow aimlessly like a river overflowing its banks. It&#x2019;s not like a jolt of electricity or a super-energy drink loaded with caffeine. Life force is integrating; it infuses the body and mind with exactly the right amount of energy to create flow, so that you are &#x201c;in the zone&#x201d; when doing what matters most to you. It guides your life when you are attuned to it and leads you on the path to fulfill your unique and special purpose for being alive. A vision of these energies is vitally important. In ancient India they were called shakti. In the Chinese tradition they were referred to as chi, and they go by other names in other ancient traditions around the world. Specific rituals were performed to increase these energies.<br><br>The words &#x201c;shakti&#x201d; or &#x201c;chi&#x201d; may sound esoteric, but what really matters is that everyone was born with it--you can see how vital, happy, curious, and vibrant a baby is. By contrast, when a grown-up feels dull, lethargic, anxious, or depressed, their life force is at low ebb. It only makes sense that maximizing your vital energy will improve your life.<br><br>Our aim is to modernize this ancient vision. The rituals that originated in ancient cultures can be adapted to our lives today. They are all about reconnection. When you are fully connected in mind, body, and spirit, you will be whole. This is our model of the ideal life.<br>THE DESIGN OF YOUR LIFE<br><br>If you look around, you can easily tell which person is leading a life with high fulfillment and performance. How? It&#x2019;s a state all of us would like to be in. Performance psychologists like Jim Loehr spend their careers helping multinational companies and Olympians connect with this life-force energy, creating breakthroughs, triumphing over crippling challenges, and achieving unusual success--all with the help of conscious, positive, consistent rituals. You can fashion the same kind of life for yourself.<br><br>It is the formal structure of ritual that allows participants to connect with the deepest aspect of their own inner nature. Look at the yoga movement, based in ancient ritual yet adapted to modern life to create connection among body, mind, and spirit. Or consider pilgrimages of the kind depicted in the popular movie The Way, which is about the famous pilgrimage route in Spain, Camino de Santiago. The lead character, played by Martin Sheen, discovers that making a pilgrimage isn&#x2019;t solely about the holy place at the end. It&#x2019;s about finding yourself, connecting with your inner peace, and hopefully touching a sacred place inside you.<br><br>These are a few examples, but there&#x2019;s a much larger design that rituals fit into. Imagine if there was a built-in structure to your life that, when you align with it, will automatically create every day the experience of flow, ease, peace, and success. Imagine this as a structure that connects you with your unique purpose and role, immersed in a sense of belonging, at peace with yourself and the world. We call this structure your Life Design.<br><br>It&#x2019;s no accident that you love the things you love. What you are drawn to, what you are passionate about, what you are good at, are all part of the unique design of your life. When you are aligned with the design, you feel joyful, fulfilled, and purposeful. When you are out of alignment, you start to get unhappy, to suffer and become miserable. This discomfort is a sign that your life is off track from fulfilling your unique purpose. Something needs adjustment.<br><br>Through the life energy that sustains you, your Life Design is constantly unfolding within every cell of your body and every part of your being. Every cell is structured in a dynamic way, bubbling with thousands of chemical reactions per second. It&#x2019;s not a static structure like a blueprint or the schematics of a computer chip.<br><br>Because the structure of a cell is dynamic, it can respond to every change in the body--how much you&#x2019;ve just eaten, how well you slept, whether your mood is elated or depressed. There&#x2019;s a tiny energy shift in every cell that reacts to these changes. Thus, every cell displays the perfect balance between order and spontaneity.<br><br>The same should be true in your life as a whole. Everyone knows the famous elevator scene in Jerry Maguire when Tom Cruise turns to a hopelessly smitten Renee Zellweger and says, &#x201c;You. Complete. Me.&#x201d; (Really? Tom Cruise looks like a guy who only needs some cool shades and a Maserati to be complete.) How is life made complete? By love, certainly, but also by investing in the things your hidden riches want to express. If every cell in your body yearns for something, that thing will make you complete. You were designed that way biologically.<br><br>Your cells thrive by exquisitely controlling the flow of energy that they use, extracted from the air and food they take in. In ancient wisdom traditions, the use of vital energy was carefully mapped out on every level. This provided an objective way to understand why being aligned with one&#x2019;s life energy produced an optimal flow while being out of alignment produced struggle. The infinite potential at the center of every life was expressed through five levels, from the most subtle to the most physical.<br><br>From your transcendent center, or spiritual core, the infinite potential that exists there radiates out through five layers. Life energy transforms into new forms before finally flowing through what are traditionally called &#x201c;the four gates&#x201d; of physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual expression. All of this activity represents your inner life. You also lead an outer life, as represented by the ring that would encompass your social role and the appearance you give to others. Even those who know you best can&#x2019;t be fully aware of your inner life, and yet when you uncover your Life Design, inner and outer begin to match much more closely. There is no question of wearing a mask or assuming a public persona that is far from the real you.<br><br>The five layers through which the potential of your life expresses itself are:<br><br>The level of Bliss--This is the place from which the joy, the aliveness, the pure delight of being alive arise. Shakti flows from this invisible source.<br><br>The level of Knowingness--This is the part of you that can &#x201c;feel&#x201d; whether something is right or not without having to think it through. It is from here that intuition arises.<br><br>The level of Mind--This includes both thoughts and emotions and is where many of us stumble. When our thoughts and emotions are self-destructive, they block access to the levels of bliss and knowingness.<br><br>The level of the Energetic--It is the energetic level that attracts or repels. Ever meet someone and feel instantly attracted, or instantly repelled? You&#x2019;re responding to the energetic field that person is projecting. When someone is dark and depressed, you feel it. When people are loving and happy, you feel that as well.<br><br>The level of the Material Form--This is the physical expression of the previous levels. You will be able to see distortion in a person&#x2019;s Life Design by their physical condition. When people are well-aligned, they look vibrant, healthy, and happy.<br><br>When you are aligned with your Life Design, the two outer rings--one representing your Inner Life, the other your Outer Life--are perfectly symmetrical. Now we have a template for the ideal life. The laws of nature and the organizing power of your life force are structured within your transcendent center. Depending on your spiritual tradition, you may refer to this transcendent center as God, Allah, Jehovah, or Brahman, but we feel more comfortable using a value-neutral term: the source of infinite potential. The flow of energy that begins here travels and transforms into body, mind, emotions, and on through every level. Since this flow is natural and effortless, the ancient seers affirmed that life as a whole can be effortless.<br><br>This is such a sweeping claim that we need to unfold it in detail. We want to show that the key to turning struggle into ease, which includes every aspect of your life, is a set of rituals that reconnect you to the flow of your life energy. Let&#x2019;s consider exactly what that means.<br>WHY IS LIFE SUCH A STRUGGLE?<br><br>You may agree with the saying that everything happens for a reason, but do you actually see the reason behind the things that happen to you? From the first shock of having a beloved pet die when you were five to hearing your parents fighting behind a closed bedroom door, from standing by helplessly when a family member contracts cancer to watching a grandparent suffer from Alzheimer&#x2019;s, there are random traumas you have no control over. They don&#x2019;t seem to happen for any reason at all. To get anywhere in life requires personal power and inner strength that enable you to weather the storms.<br><br>This brings us directly to the mind. Imagine a huge warehouse whose doors are open. You step inside and look around. The space is empty, and in the dim lighting it seems to run on forever. The warehouse is so vast that anything and everything could be stored inside it.<br><br>This warehouse is your mind. The vast space waiting to be filled is your potential. No one told us as kids that filling this warehouse isn&#x2019;t voluntary--it&#x2019;s a requirement for every single person. Every experience, good or bad, from the moment of birth, has been adding to your mind. Now that you&#x2019;re an adult, you&#x2019;ve gone a long way toward filling your mind with thoughts, feelings, memories, and all kinds of things. Nobody fills the mind in exactly the same way.<br><br>The most fortunate, happy, and successful people have discovered a secret about the mind. For these people, the mind isn&#x2019;t just a warehouse for random thoughts and feelings, impulses and desires. It&#x2019;s a place of hidden riches. All the love you will experience in your whole life--past, present, and future--is experienced here. Your hopes will be fulfilled here. Joy is here in abundance, once you know how to uncover it. The most valuable thing anyone can learn is how to find these hidden riches.<br><br>Failing to uncover these riches results in a life marked by disorder and confusion. Many people have turned the warehouse into a teenager&#x2019;s bedroom. Everything&#x2019;s a jumble. The floor is littered with whatever got picked up and tossed back down. The walls are cluttered with posters, stickers, perhaps a stolen stop sign, or sports logos.

They work incredibly hard to get external rewards like money, the right job, a beautiful home. But despite the best planning and motivation, they feel frustrated. Too much of their inner potential has gone wasted or undiscovered.<br><br>This makes us think of Jonathan, now in his mid-forties, who followed his vision of being a self-made success. Jonathan knew as a teenager that he was a born salesman. He could talk to anyone. His outgoing personality quickly lowered social barriers, and he had tons of enthusiasm for any project he started.<br><br>And he started a lot. His mind was always whirling with the next bright idea. Having skipped college to start selling land in Florida, he quickly became restless. As much as his co-workers and bosses liked him, Jonathan gained a reputation for not following through. Contracts bored him, and so did seeing to all the nitpicking details of punch sheets and the complaints of renters. He moved on--to land sales in Colorado, car sales in California, then back to real estate. His restlessness ended only when he settled down with Karen, a loving wife.<br><br>A good period followed, in which Jonathan was able to start his own boat business, with a dream of one day selling yachts. &#x201c;If you&#x2019;re a born salesman,&#x201d; he told his friends, &#x201c;try and sell the biggest-ticket item you can. It&#x2019;s no harder than selling used VWs.&#x201d; But with all this enthusiasm and personal gifts, Jonathan never made his dreams come true. The telltale signs were always there:<br><br>He was impulsive, always following the next bright idea.<br><br>He hated being tied down to an orderly routine.<br><br>He left follow-through to others.<br><br>His financial affairs were always a mess, leading to money shortages and tax problems.<br><br>Above all, Jonathan&#x2019;s life didn&#x2019;t teach him any valuable lessons on which he could build a better future. Now divorced and falling back on low-level sales jobs, Jonathan is an example no one wants to imitate. But we feel a lot of sympathy for him, because millions of people are victims of mental messiness, lack of impulse control, and the inability to really develop their natural gifts.<br><br>In many cases this is a result of failing to discover and understand their own genius (yes, we all have genius) embedded in their Life Design.

Fulfilling your potential happens in the present. Here and now you must meet daily challenges, find solutions, and move forward.

This is definitely a novel that rewards re-reading. When you read it again, you can pay more attention to the theme of country folk vs. city folk; the parallel marriage conflicts of the Cambers vs. the Trentons; the poignancy of the amiable St. Bernard (yes, the breed choice is just right) infected by a brain-destroying virus that makes it into a monster; and the way the "daylight burial" of the failed ad campaign is reflected in the sunlit Pinto that becomes a coffin. And how significant it is that this horror tale is <i>not</i> supernatural: it's as real as junk food, a failing marriage, a broken-down car, or a fatal virus.Stephen King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947.

But the friendly wind and a cooperative cloud intervene to quiet all nighttime melodies and deliver a gentle &#34;Good night.&#34;</p><p>No BioPreSchool-Grade 1-Although it is late, a young girl cannot fall asleep because the creatures outside her window are making too much noise. The night wind tries to quiet them, but it is only when it blows a cloud over the Earth and the moon stops shining that the moth stops dancing, the frog stops strumming his base fiddle, the cricket stops playing his violin, the mockingbird stops singing, and the child falls asleep. Youngsters will delight in the language of this story in which music spills from deep in a mockingbird's throat, a cricket's toes tap while his coattails flap, and a frog gets "lost in the beat, with a night full of rhythm in his hands and feet." Jorgensen's pencil drawings in soft night shades illumined only by the moon and some whimsical fireflies (alert readers will notice their lantern tails) depict fun-loving animals reluctant to end another day. This splendid bedtime story is perfect for a restless child, and its large pictures render it equally suitable for story time or classroom use. The cumulative narrative invites group participation.

Many, in their dealings with Native Americans, witnessed a broad spectrum of tribal life. Peter Skeene Ogden (1794-1854), explorer, author, and Hudson&#x2019;s Bay Company employee, was one such observer &#x2014; astute, immensely literate for his time, and knowledgeable in a number of regional Indian languages. This fascinating volume, attributed to Ogden, provides an illuminating and sometimes startling account of day-to-day life among the original inhabitants of the Oregon Territory.<br>Identifying himself only as &#x201c;A Fur Trader,&#x201d; Ogden presents intimate sketches of tribal life collected over two decades of encounters with Indians of the Northwest. More than just brief glimpses into warlike habits, this book describes in graphic and often touching prose a wealth of customs, traditions, beliefs, rituals, and daily activities of Indian life &#x2014; even including scenes of domestic tragedy.<br>Originally published in 1853, this rare document offers authentic insight into the Indian character and intratribal life during a period in which only few hardened adventurers had gained access to the isolated areas of the Far West. A splendid tribute to those who did, Ogden&#x2019;s painstakingly detailed yet immensely readable firsthand account will be welcomed by anthropologists, students of Native American society and life, and general readers alike.</p><p></p><h2>The Tightrope Walker</h2><p>The Tightrope Walker</p><p></p><h2>Ghana Mali Songhay: The Western Sudan (African Kingdoms of the Past)</h2><p>A study of the legends and history of the ancient West African kingdoms of Ghana, Mali, and Songhay, including background and commentary on Islam&#39;s influence in the region</p><p>Grade 4-8?This eloquently written book opens with a retelling of the West African legend of the fearless warrior Amadou Sefedokote, who slew the sacred serpent Ouagadou-Bida and rescued the beautiful Sia from sacrificial death. The focus then shifts to the rise and fall of the once powerful empires of Ghana, Mali, and Songhay. An intriguing sidelight is the additional information provided on the beginnings of Islam; its spread and impact in West Africa; and background information on its founder, Mohammed. The Mandinka Empire of Mali and its kings, Sundiata and Mansa Musa, and the Songhay Empire and its kings, Sunni Ali Ber and Askia Mohammed Toure, are also discussed. The epilogue mentions how Europeans, lured by the news of gold, came to West Africa and ended up in the slave trade. The McKissacks' The Royal Kingdoms of Ghana, Mali, and Songhay (Holt, 1995) provides more detail and information on the same subjects.

We feel inadequate and reluctant, but at the same time eager to see our friends come to Christ. Know and Tell the Gospel deals with all the questions that so quickly come to mind on this subject. Just what is the gospel anyway? Is it my job to explain it to people? What is God&#39;s role and what is mine? Where does church fit in? Why is evangelism so often hard? And how can we train ourselves and others to be involved? In his characteristically friendly and engaging way, &#39;Chappo&#39; provides warm encouragement, insightful biblical teaching, and a wealth of practical information on evangelism for all Christians. This new edition has been extensively revised and re-written, and contains up-to-date information and evaluation on current resources for evangelism. A must read for every Christian who is keen to take the gospel to our lost world.</p><p></p><h2>Paths of Desire: The Passions of a Suburban Gardener</h2><p>Traces the author&#39;s endeavors to restore and recreate her suburban garden, an effort during which she combated pests, neighborhood ecological limitations, and other elements while discovering the joys of organic gardening.</p><p><b>Dominique Browning</b> has been the editor in chief of <i>House &amp; Garden</i> since 1995. She was previously the editor of <i>Mirabella,</i> an assistant managing editor of <i>Newsweek,</i> and the executive editor of <i>Texas Monthly.</i> She lives in New York with her two teenage sons.<b>TWO: GROUNDS FOR RENOVATION</b><p></p><blockquote><i>"The great way is very level; But people delight in torturous paths."</i><p></p><blockquote> -- Lao-tzu <p><i>Te Tao Ching</i></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>One day, soon after we had moved into the house, I walked out the back door from the kitchen and saw a couple of mysterious plants poking, with great determination, their way out from the edge of the driveway. Fugitives from a buried bed. I had never seen such plants in my life. Two strong stalks of dusty green with thick leaves ranked up the sides, they grew taller and taller -- I felt like Jack watching his beans rise -- until they reached a height of five feet. The stalks were noble and erect, as if they were flagpoles from which would unfurl heraldic banners. Then the stalks began to bloom, a profusion of blossoms up and down their length of a mottled, breathtaking, unnameable blue. A Botticelli blue. A blue close to the clearest depths of southern seas, or the celestial orbs frescoed on the ceilings of old churches. And then again, a blue that lay closer to the inky mauve of a slow dusk. The color was shifting, changeable. This was my introduction to the aristocratic delphinium. For years afterward, I searched the garden catalogs to find a flower that resembled the ones that seemed to have come down to my backyard from the heavens; I figured out that they were a hybrid of the <i>elatum</i> group, but I have faltered in finding the color, which hovers elusively, winking at me, somewhere between the "Blue Nile" and "Bruce." It is like that blue spot in the middle of the darkness behind your eyeballs, the so-called Blue Pearl at the heart of meditation, that the seeker finds only upon transcending time and place and the need to scratch an itch. I have read about it, but will never find it. I had seen the mythic delphinium; I was soon to lose it forever. Those flowers that appeared at the back of the driveway came bearing a message, I was sure. It was time to start a new bed in the back. That was how we came to rip out the parking lot.</p><p>Parking lot? you say. It was an unusual landscaping feature, to say the least, for a suburban backyard -- at least in those days. It was an extension of the driveway, tucked around behind the kitchen at the back of the house, paved and fenced off from the rest of the yard. A beautiful old pink rose, with trunks as thick as my wrists, spilled over the fence rails. The previous owner, who had had a sister and several grown children living with her, had needed to accommodate many cars. We owned but one car, so we pried up the asphalt and replaced it with flagstone, and, shoving some dirt up against the ungainly concrete wall that seemed to be the only thing keeping the uphill neighbor's garage from sliding into our yard, we created a slightly raised bed, held in place with a low stone wall. The neighbor's garage -- which was actually a beautiful old wreck of a stone carriage house -- loomed above my new garden area, the Back Bed, and its granite walls trapped the heat of the winter sun and kept the climate behind the house mild.</p><p>The Back Bed was about four feet deep and twenty-seven feet long. As it was in the sunniest part of the yard, it readily took on whatever perennials I could squeeze into it; they thrived. The patio off the kitchen instantly became the summer dining room, where I could gaze happily at the new flowers. What's more, the Back Bed had the advantage of partly shrouding more than half of the band of concrete retaining wall that ran partway across the back of the property -- and what a nasty wall it was. It had nothing to recommend it save for its Atlas-like devotion to holding up the neighbors' world. It did not even seem to weather properly, but stayed the same mealy and uninteresting color through every season.</p><p>(Over the following years I would try to further mask the wall with various covers and creepers, the unfortunate <i>Euonymus fortunei,</i> or wintercreeper, and English ivy, <i>Hedera helix,</i> but though all these plants were considered invasive, they seemed to bake right off in the hot sun, as if my wall were repellent even to a pest. Finally, years after the creation of the Back Bed, I would plant a clematis, <i>montana,</i> at one end of the wall, simply because I had ordered too much of it for a different spot. I had no hope for its survival, as I had always thought that clematis was a fragile, fussy thing. But it was so wildly contented with its spot at the end of the wall that within a year I was able to train it down the length of concrete; it cascaded off the top. It bloomed profusely every spring, its small white flowers glowing into the night, and I thought I had triumphed over the wall, until one year, after a severe -- and accidental -- pruning, the clematis became demented, and began to twine its way into everything else in the bed, haywire, strangling whatever it could. I had never seen such a coy, robust invader. The wall, clearly, was cursed. I decided to ignore it. Little did I know of the perils of ignoring trouble.)</p><p>With guidance from a Design Expert at a nearby nursery, I planted a row of shrubs in the Back Bed, to pick up the line of some shrubs that were already in place along the back of the yard -- three hydrangea, because of the two old hydrangea at the back of the house, which bloomed a hard, almost green white late in the summer, then tarnished, fading into a beautiful rosy blush of powdery old age. In the new bed I planted a standardized form; I felt that would look more delicate, balletic, sending its sprays of flowers twirling from a central trunk. Because there were already some in the yard, I alternated the hydrangea with two althea, or rose of Sharon, shrubs that would grow in a vase shape that I admired. Their flowers also came late in the season; they were white with a crimson center, and there seemed an endless supply of them. The shrubs looked so small and forlorn, once they were in, that I decided to fill the spaces between them with perennials. And so I squeezed into the Back Bed anything and everything I liked from the catalogs, augmented by supplies from the local nursery. Lavender, rosemary, phlox, hollyhock, foxglove, mint -- oh, the mistakes I made -- sedum, daisies. I spent lavishly, extravagantly; I gardened licentiously.</p><p>I had been intimidated by flowers, at first, but then was seduced by the catalogs. I loved reading the names of things, the way it felt to say them, mouthing my way into the private language of the gardener. <i>Monarda,</i> with its swelling, soothing, matronly vowels -- bee balm. <i>Echinacea,</i> sounding like the very sneeze the coneflower was meant to ward off. The silvery <i>artemisia,</i> surely a fairy's flower. <i>Campanula,</i> ringing in morning devotions. Over the next few years, I ordered and crammed and moved and tended and lost and yanked and killed. You can never know what will work in your garden until you try it. And discipline of design is harder won, and all the more satisfying, when it has conquered the instinct for profligacy. My hand would eventually grow firmer, my eye more sophisticated. But neither was of interest to me in the early days of gardening.</p><p>In my first years with the Back Bed, I was a blissfully ignorant gardener, and, although it was masked by the extravagant planting, I was also quite insecure. I put in the shrubs to give "structure," as I had an idea that shrubs made bones, and bones were virtuous. I copied what was already in the yard so that I could feel safe about my choices. And at the same time I was riotously haphazard; sloppy, really, troweling in anything that caught my eye, or ear, with no regard to color, size, habit, or overall effect. </p><p>I sometimes wished I could have been like those professional landscape designers who go to a paint store, mix chips of color together until they find a pleasing combination, and then plant accordingly, sticking to the plan no matter what the temptations of the nursery. The best that could be said of my efforts was that I had tender feelings about whatever went into the Back Bed. Eventually I grew to appreciate that a solicitous touch was at least as important as a ruthless eye. </p><p>One day in early spring, a few months before the collapse of the retaining wall, workmen began to mill around the stone carriage house. The house had been neglected for years, which gave it charm, I thought, but also made it an appealing home for skunks and rats. Not so charming. I watched from my kitchen window over the next few months as the men rebuilt the crumbling chimney, shored up the foundations, trimmed the roof in gleaming copper gutters. They replaced rotting window sashes, then replaced the old glass (one of the panes shattered by a son's errant -- so I was told -- baseball). I could peer into the bottom floor and see a furnace being dismantled and a new one being assembled. Electricians arrived, and stringy tangles of charred wire were removed and neat coils of shiny wire brought in.</p><p>I had new neighbors.</p><p>One morning, I woke to the grinding, scraping noise of bulldozers, and the sound of dynamite blasting rock out of the ground.</p><p>The new neighbors had ambitions.</p><p>The carriage house was the least of it. The main structure was an elaborate, four-story, stone-and-stucco Victorian layer cake of a house, one of the oldest in town, dating from the 1890s, swagged with rotting porches, boasting a gorgeous old slate roof of a soft, tarnished silver color, the loss of whose shingles was highly entertaining, if you were lucky enough to catch a showing. The slates would dislodge themselves, slide slowly down the slope of the roof, gather speed, and careen madly off the edge to the driveway far below, shattering deliciously. The house had been standing empty for a long time, caught in a muddle of estates and lawyers and distant relatives; its previous owner, a reclusive, eccentric, wealthy old woman who, it was said, kept all her money in brown paper bags in the closets, had died, alone in the house, years earlier. The house was now coming back to life, teeming with carpenters, masons, electricians, plumbers, and every other ...</p></p><h2>Mr. Yowder and the Train Robbers</h2><p>Mr. Yowder, a vacationing sign painter, outwits a band of robbers with the help of a rattlesnake he has befriended</p><p></p><h2>Modern Native Feasts: Healthy, Innovative, Sustainable Cuisine</h2><p><p>Native American cuisine comes of age in this elegant, contemporary collection that reinterprets and updates traditional Native recipes with modern, healthy twists.

Her sixteen years at the Art Institute of Chicago coincided with that institution&#x2019;s emergence as one of the world&#x2019;s greatest museums. She chronicled two decades of contemporary art as a critic at the Saturday Review. Kuh died in 1994.[Signature]Reviewed by <i>James Lord</i>This love affair provides for those who care about art and artists a piercing, passionate glimpse of creative activity in America during the first half of the 20th century. Kuh (1904&#x2013;1994) saw everything, knew everybody, went everywhere and in the miraculous lucidity of her old, old age still had the wit and discernment to tell the story of her vision, knowledge and travels. It is, of course, a very personal tale. The raison d'�tre of memoirs is not merely to relate experience but also to reveal the personality of the author. Thus, Kuh discloses how and why art became, as it were, the very backbone of her physical and spiritual adventure. It required exceptional courage and intellectual discipline. The revelations are aided and abetted, so to speak, by Kuh's friend, admirer and accomplice, Avis Berman, who edited and completed the manuscript after the author's death, at 89, and who disclosed vital information that Kuh's reticence would have set aside, describing, for example, details of the love affairs which contributed essential elements to the passion of art.Passionate as it indeed is, this around-the-art-world voyage invited mainly the happy few as fellow passengers. And Kuh possessed the resilient temperament enabling her to sail audaciously along when the happy few were very few. Almost all of her professional and emotional life was spent in Chicago, the pivotal center of the aesthetic doldrums then prevailing in America's cultural badlands. New York was artistically far more exciting, but Katharine was determined to create excitement within spitting distance of the stockyards.She opened her own gallery there in 1935, the nadir of the Great Depression, when even in New York it was difficult to give away a drawing by, say, Bonnard. Nonetheless, the gallery prevailed, introducing unheard of and unwelcome artists to Chicago, where a handful of prescient adventurers were prepared to pay a pittance for pictures their neighbors considered evidence of madness. Kuh's courage was rewarded when she was appointed to the prestigious post of curator at the Art Institute of Chicago, a museum which her sharp eye enriched with fine examples of avant-garde modernism.The love affair with the art of her time came fully into its own after WWII, when the enamored connoisseur developed close friendships with the artists, collectors and curators whom she had intimate cause to admire. The larger part of her autobiography is an account of her devotion to these individuals, almost all of them celebrated today: Brancusi, Mies van der Rohe, V.W. van Gogh, Rothko, Clyfford Sti�ll, Tobey, Berenson, Albers, L�ger, Franz Kline et al. Her reminiscences vividly draw the reader into a deep sympathy for her love affair. Succinctly written, it is a fine memorial to a memorable journey.<i>James Lord is the author of </i>Picasso and Dora<i>,</i> Six Exceptional Women <i>and, most recently, </i>Mythic Giacometti<i>, all published by Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux.</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Miss Krauss and the many children who made suggestions, re-visions, additions (and subtractions) to this book say, "Eyebrows are to go over eyes." A face? "A face is something to have on the front of your head." Also, "a face is so you can make faces." Hands? Well, hands are to hold. And also "a hand is to hold up when you want your turn." "A party is to say how-do-you-do and shake hands" and also "a party is to make little children happy."

Then a staff reporter for <i>The New York Times</i>, he was heading into the city to survey the damage. The Interstate was eerily empty. Soldiers in uniform and armed with assault rifles stopped him. Water reached the eaves of houses for as far as the eye could see.<br> <br>Four out of every five houses&#x2014;eighty percent of the city&#x2019;s housing stock&#x2014;had been flooded. Around that same proportion of schools and businesses were wrecked. The weight of all that water on the streets cracked gas and water and sewer pipes all around town and the deluge had drowned almost every power substation and rendered unusable most of the city&#x2019;s water and sewer system.<br> <br>People living in flooded areas of the city could not be expected to pay their property taxes for the foreseeable future. Nor would all those boarded-up businesses&#x2014;21,000 of the city&#x2019;s 22,000 businesses were still shuttered six months after the storm&#x2014;be contributing their share of sales taxes and other fees to the city&#x2019;s coffers. Six weeks after the storm, the city laid off half its workforce&#x2014;precisely when so many people were turning to its government for help. Meanwhile, cynics both in and out of the Beltway were questioning the use of taxpayer dollars to rebuild a city that sat mostly below sea level. How could the city possibly come back?<br> <br>This book traces the stories of New Orleanians of all stripes&#x2014;politicians and business owners, teachers and bus drivers, poor and wealthy, black and white&#x2014;as they confront the aftermath of one of the great tragedies of our age and reconstruct, change, and in some cases abandon a city that&#x2019;s the soul of this nation.</p><p>Gary Rivlin is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter and the author of five books, including <i>Katrina: After the Flood</i>.

The bosses running the city&#x2019;s transit agency needed to offer more than money to convince the bus drivers, streetcar operators, mechanics, and others they needed to stay in town through a big storm. So in August 2005, with a hurricane named Katrina bearing down on New Orleans, they did as they had in the past ahead of previous scares: they opened up the agency&#x2019;s headquarters, a three-story brick fortress on Canal Street on the edge of the city&#x2019;s central business district. &#x201c;To get the volunteers we needed, we&#x2019;d allow them to bring their spouses, their children, grandmothers, grandfathers, girlfriends, nieces, nephews, whoever,&#x201d; said Bill Deville, then the general manager of the New Orleans Regional Transit Authority.<br> <br>The A. Philip Randolph Building&#x2014;what RTA employees called the &#x201c;Canal Street barn&#x201d; or simply &#x201c;the barn&#x201d;&#x2014;was hardly the Hilton. People slept on air mattresses and needed to bring their own food. But the barn was also a veritable fort, stocked with military food rations and water and with its own backup generator. Most important, it was in a part of town that everyone knew never flooded. &#x201c;People really want to be together in a protected facility,&#x201d; Deville said.<br> <br>Around the region, the traffic on the highways out of town ahead of Katrina was heaviest on Sunday. The storm wouldn&#x2019;t hit New Orleans until early on Monday morning. Yet the city&#x2019;s bus drivers and others needed to work on Sunday, picking up people at evacuation centers around the city and dropping them off at the Superdome. Thus, on Saturday the RTA employees, their families, and their friends started showing up at the barn, dragging with them their suitcases and carrying coolers, and the occasional large silver pot heavy with gumbo. By Sunday night, somewhere around three hundred people were taking refuge there. The group, around 90 percent black, included grandparents and a couple of babies. Only around one-third worked for the RTA. People plugged in hot plates to heat up their food and shared the flasks and bottles they had brought with them. By 10:00 p.m., the winds sounded like a jet engine roaring. By midnight, the pounding rain echoed through the building. Why not a party when there was nothing to do except wait?<br> <br>MONDAY<br> <br>Gerald Robichaux, the RTA&#x2019;s deputy general manager for operations, was up early Monday morning. He saw water in the streets and immediately regretted his decision to leave the agency&#x2019;s three big dump trucks parked at the Uptown facility a few miles away, along with the big rigs they used to tow disabled buses. These trucks with tires as tall as the average-size man, Robichaux realized, might prove to be their chariots of escape if the water in the streets kept rising. Robichaux ordered a small crew to take the single high-wheeled vehicle they had at the Canal Street barn and pick up the other rigs on Napoleon Avenue. Robichaux also asked Wilfred Eddington to join them. Eddington was a member of the New Orleans Police Department, and part of the RTA&#x2019;s transit police unit.<br> <br>The wind was still blowing at around fifty miles per hour when they pulled out of the barn at around 10:00 a.m. Eddington remembered a blue Chevy parked at the Chevron station a block away. The water, maybe curb high, reached the bottom of the Chevy&#x2019;s hubcaps. The water was halfway up the car&#x2019;s windows when they returned ninety minutes later.<br> <br>Back at the barn, the men told Robichaux what they had seen. They had headed west and south of downtown expecting to see at least some flooding in Uptown, which often gets an inch or two of water after a hard rain. But Uptown was dry. Only closer to their building had they hit any real flooding. Needing to see for himself, Robichaux called out the names of a few of his top people and jumped into one of the big trucks. Bill Deville decided to join his number two and almost immediately regretted his decision. The fifty-eight-year-old general manager was taking medicine for a bad heart. He took another pill to manage his high blood pressure. Just getting to the rig meant walking through foul, brackish water up past his knees. Only once it was too late did Deville remember a cut on his leg.<br> <br>Robichaux was anxious to see the large facility the RTA operated in the eastern part of the city, in New Orleans East. With water starting to leak into the ground floor of the Canal Street barn, that might need to serve as their temporary base for running the city&#x2019;s transit agency. Once on the interstate, Robichaux realized he had bigger problems than figuring out what day they might restart bus and streetcar service. Water was in every direction, sometimes up to the eaves of one-story homes. The I-10 became impassable after a couple of miles of driving, forcing them to turn back.<br> <br>At some point on Monday the toilets stopped working&#x2014;no small concern in a building housing around three hundred people. Landlines weren&#x2019;t working and cell phone coverage was spotty. They weren&#x2019;t completely cut off, however. The police scanner was still working, which is how they learned about the levee breaches. Bill Deville called everyone together late Monday afternoon to relay the bad news. He reminded them of the dozens of pumping stations the city operated around town and how effectively these miracle machines soaked up excess water. &#x201c;It will probably take another day or so for the water to subside,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>TUESDAY<br> <br>Gerald Robichaux and several supervisors were up early on Tuesday making rounds. So much water had gotten inside the building overnight that the emergency generator was submerged, rendering it useless. They were low on food and almost out of water. Walking around the building, they could feel the rising panic. Older people were running low on medicines. Mothers needed clean diapers. Robichaux went looking for his boss.<br> <br>Deville had gone straight to his office after delivering the bad news about the city&#x2019;s broken levees. He had lain down on the couch, but who could sleep in the stupefying heat and with his cut leg feeling as if it were on fire? In the middle of the night, Deville grabbed a flashlight and headed to his car, parked in the employee parking lot. He turned on the engine, set the air conditioner to high, and fell asleep.<br> <br>Robichaux rapped on the roof of Deville&#x2019;s car. Deville&#x2019;s first feeling was confusion, then shame. It had been dark when he&#x2019;d closed his eyes, but he was squinting against the brightness. How long had he been asleep? he asked himself groggily. Three hours? Four? &#x201c;We need to leave,&#x201d; Robichaux told him. He gave Deville a grim update and then laid out the plan Robichaux and a few others had hatched. We&#x2019;ll give people a choice, Robichaux said. They were maybe a dozen blocks from an entrance ramp to an elevated portion of the I-10. They could wade or swim to that ramp. They knew from listening to the radio and police scanners that the streets were dry on the other side of the Mississippi River. Those who felt up to it could walk a few miles on the elevated I-10 to the Crescent City Connection, the bridge that took traffic over the Mississippi River to the West Bank. With some luck, they could contact the drivers of the big coaches they had parked in LaPlace, a town halfway between New Orleans and Baton Rouge, and arrange to be picked up at the park&nbsp;&#x2019;n&#x2019;&nbsp;ride commuter lot the RTA operated on the West Bank. Those who did not feel up to the long walk could remain in the barn while a small scouting party searched for boats to ferry them to safety.<br> <br>A meeting was held on the roof parking lot later that morning. De�ville asked Robichaux to explain his idea, but this no-nonsense manager who was so adept at making the buses run more or less on time wasn&#x2019;t necessarily the best messenger in the midst of a crisis. Robichaux admitted they had no idea how deep the water was to the ramp. He then told the group to split into two. He asked those who could swim to gather on one side of the roof and those who couldn&#x2019;t on the other. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re leaving us to drown,&#x201d; some of the nonswimmers called out.<br> <br>Deville stepped up on the back of a pickup truck. &#x201c;No one is leaving anyone behind,&#x201d; he assured them. They had air mattresses, he said. They would float people who couldn&#x2019;t swim. He also made a promise: &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll stay with anyone who doesn&#x2019;t feel up to the walk.&#x201d; Afterward, people patted him on the back for his bravery, but he felt like a fraud. &#x201c;I was scared to death,&#x201d; Deville confessed. &#x201c;People thought I was a hero for volunteering to stay behind, but I can&#x2019;t swim. Plus there was no way I was stepping another foot in that water.&#x201d; While still standing on the flatbed, Deville told the crowd of a conversation he had had that morning with someone in the governor&#x2019;s office. He&#x2019;d promised to send helicopters as soon as any were available. Maybe those who remained at the barn would be the first ones rescued.<br> <br>A LITTLE PAST NOON on Tuesday, August 30, 2005, the first RTA employees dropped themselves into the dark, murky waters that were chest high on a six-foot man. Around two-thirds of their group&#x2014;two hundred people&#x2014;chose to walk rather than remain. Children were hoisted on air mattresses, along with most everyone standing under maybe five feet five inches tall. Those tall enough to walk sloshed through the smelly, oily water, guiding the others on the makeshift rafts. Sharon Paul, a fifty-year-old RTA dispatcher, was a diabetic who had already gone more than twenty-four hours without her insulin. But Paul was a strong swimmer. She helped a pregnant woman heft herself onto an air mattress along with a pair of toddlers. Paul then tied a rope around her waist and towed the three of them. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m done,&#x201d; she said, collapsing once they reached the elevated highway. She&#x2019;d need to walk another six miles to make the park &#x2019;n&#x2019; ride on the West Bank.<br> <br>Some had thought they were strong enough to make it the half mile to the interstate but were not. Others froze in place. Ruben Stephens, an NOPD lieutenant who headed up the RTA&#x2019;s police unit, helped with the stragglers. &#x201c;People were petrified of the water,&#x201d; Stephens said. Wilfred Eddington was already sitting on top of the interstate with his boots off when Robichaux asked him and another officer to help coax people to the interstate. He laced up his boots and headed down the ramp and into the muck. &#x201c;Our job was to make sure that we got everybody to that bridge,&#x201d; Eddington said.<br> <br>Staying together was a challenge. They had imagined walking as a single group toward the twin cantilevered bridges looming a couple of miles away. Ruben Stephens, the police lieutenant, ordered Eddington to the front of the line. Stephens and several other officers retreated to the back of the group to wrangle any strays. People passed the Superdome, standing like a giant spaceship next to the highway, and stared. Some in their contingent had been at the dome as recently as Sunday, where orderly lines of people were waiting to be patted down (people were being checked for weapons) before they were admitted to this &#x201c;shelter of last resort.&#x201d; Now thick crowds of people milled everywhere while nearby the National Guardsmen stood holding weapons. Pieces of the Superdome&#x2019;s roof had peeled off. The giant Hyatt Regency next door&#x2014;where the mayor and his top people were&#x2014;looked worse. Almost every window on the northern face of the hotel was shattered.<br> <br>They passed clots of five or ten people, but no other contingent was nearly as large as theirs, and none seemed to be walking with the same purpose. The temperature was in the nineties and the humidity high. From the interstate they had an expansive view of watery New Orleans&#x2014;a perfect vantage point for contemplating a drowned-out home. A torpor took over all but the strongest among them, but they kept walking. The bridge ahead led to Algiers, the New Orleans neighborhood on the other side of the Mississippi. Only later did they appreciate that it was also the route to white-flight suburbs such as Gretna, the first town they would reach once they had crossed the Crescent City Connection. At least one of them was in a wheelchair, and their ranks included grandmothers, toddlers, and several police officers. None seemed to be thinking about what it meant that theirs was an almost all-black group heading into a predominantly white community.<br> <br>A bus driver named Malcolm Butler and his wife, Dorothy, were among the first to notice the blockade. Initially, Malcolm Butler thought his eyes were playing tricks on him in the hot, midday sun. Butler was set to retire, after thirty-three years on the job, on August 31&#x2014;the next day. Their home in New Orleans East had most certainly flooded, and then there were the fresh horrors of their walk from the Canal Street barn to the interstate. Butler, who is not tall, had walked through greasy water up to his neck, his nose and chin pointed upward, guiding Dorothy, who clung to an air mattress. They had probably been on the interstate for less than an hour&#x2014;enough so that their clothes had dried out even if the stink of the water remained&#x2014;when Butler stopped and asked Dorothy if she was seeing what he was: a pair of police officers brandishing weapons, blocking their passage. &#x201c;They was standing up there with their automobiles blocking the bridge with shotguns and M16s and told us we couldn&#x2019;t go no further,&#x201d; Butler recalled.<br> <br>Wilfred Eddington, the police officer assigned to walk point as they headed toward the West Bank, figured he was around one thousand yards from the foot of the bridge when he saw the two police cars parked nose to nose, forming a wedge to block their passage. Eventually, he heard them yelling, &#x201c;Go back! Go back! Get off the bridge!&#x201d; He noticed their black uniforms&#x2014;they were members of the small force responsible for policing the bridge.<br> <br>Eddington was dressed in jeans but wearing a dark T-shirt stamped with the word POLICE in large letters. He wore a holstered gun on his belt. He asked the others to slow down while he approached his counterparts. The smaller of the two bridge cops, a young black woman, didn&#x2019;t seem to care what it said on Eddington&#x2019;s shirt. The closer he got, the louder she seemed to scream. &#x201c;She was out of control,&#x201d; Eddington said. &#x201c;She was irate.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You gotta bring it down a few notches,&#x201d; Eddington said, looking at the female officer. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re now at around ten.

After a century in which the lexicon of artists&#39; materials expanded from the classic oil, canvas, stone and plaster to include photography, film, performance, found objects and concepts, the spotlight has finally swung back. A new generation of artists--as well as some who never abandoned figurative painting in the first place--is relishing the solitary, slow, subtle set of processes involved in not just painting, but painting people. They are choosing paint&#39;s unique ability to distill a lifetime of events rather than photography&#39;s glimpse of a frozen moment. Painting People, edited by the prominent London art historian and critic Charlotte Mullins, unites and contrasts the work of a key group of artists from around the world and investigates their richly varied accomplishments in lucid text with detailed commentaries accompanied by more than 150 reproductions. The list of contributing artists is stellar, ranging from photo-based painters like Luc Tuymans, P</p><p><b>Chris Ofili</b> (born 1968) is an English painter noted for works referencing aspects of his African background. He is one of the best-known Young British Artists, a Turner Prize winner, and the source of one of the New York art world's biggest scandals. It was Ofili's painting, a depiction of a black African Virgin Mary surrounded by images from blaxploitation movies and close-ups of female genitalia cut from pornographic magazines, that caused then-Mayor Rudolph Giuliani to close the infamous <i>Sensation</i> exhibition at The Brooklyn Museum in 1999.Well documented with artists' biographies, a selected bibliography, a list of illustrations, and an index, this superbly conceived book makes the art of figure painting understandable to diverse audiences. It belongs in most academic, special, and public libraries that have art book collections.

Despite diversity of media, technique, and form, these contemporary African and African American art works and the artists who created them are united by a rich network of connections, exchanges, and associations generated from both shores of the Middle Passage. Collected in this book are 24 color reproductions of the art of seven African artists: Skunder Boghossian, Sokari Douglas Camp, Rashid Diab, Amir Nour, Moyo Ogundipe, Moyo Okediji, and Ouattara - and seven African American artists: Jean-Michel Basquiat, John Biggers, Jeff Donaldson, Yvonne Edwards-Tucker, Winnie Owens-Hart, Charles Searles, and Al Smith. Paintings, mixed media, sculptures, and ceramics reflect issues of identity while expressing beauty, pulsating rhythms, and a sense of improvisation among bursts of colour and quieter, more contemplative moments. American artist and scholar Michael D. Harris and Nigerian artist and scholar Moyo Okediji construct a dialogue in companion essays that explore departures and arrivals, connections and distinctions between contemporary African and African American artists. Although the influence of African art on African American artists has received considerable attention, this book is among the first to discuss the influence of African American art on African artists, an exchange that continues to produce art that is both culturally unique and aesthetically rich. Michael D. Harris is assistant professor of African and African American art history at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

Wrecks like those of the Titanic and the Lusitania are the stuff of legend, but what about the hundreds of others throughout history, their unique stories, their causes and their influence on maritime history? Shipwrecks documents many of these while offering dozens of entries on related topics, such as reefs, radar, storms and capsizing. More than just a catalog of the world's best-known maritime disasters, Shipwrecks captures the drama and historical significance of these calamities. Over 80 charts and illustrations highlight this fully cross-referenced and indexed work.<br>From among hundreds of shipwrecks, author David Ritchie has selected only those of particular historical, cultural and technological importance, those that have, among other things, shocked the world, moved nations to war and led to improvements in nautical design. Shipwrecks brings to life the most significant disasters in maritime history, from the wrecks of Columbus' Santa Maria and the Andrea Doria to those of the French liner Normandie and the British frigate Phoenix. Over 400 entries depict in vivid detail the captains, the ships, the causes and the casualties associated with these tragedies, making Shipwrecks a useful reference as well as an entertaining and educational one.</p><p>In this large volume Ritchie (UFO: The Definitive Guide to Unidentified Flying Objects and Related Phenomena, LJ 1/95) lists several hundred shipwrecks alphabetically by ship name; vessels named after people are in last name order. The greatest number of wrecks he includes date from the middle 1800s to the 1940s. Specifically excluded are ships sunk during combat. Some wrecks are given page-long coverage and contain many colorful anecdotes. Other entries offer only the bare essentials of when, where, and how the ship sank. Ritchie gives good, balanced accounts of such controversial wrecks as the Mary Celeste, SS Waratah, Lusitania, and Titanic. He presents all sides and tries to tell as accurate a story as current theories allow. He also includes a chronology of shipwrecks and a brief bibliography. While no work could list all shipwrecks, his reference would be a nice addition for public library reference collections.<br><i>John Kenny, San Francisco P.L.</i><br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Hawaii Island Legends: Pele, Pikoi, and Others</h2><p>Favorite legends of the hero Pikoi, the goddess Pele, and other folk of the Big Island.</p><p></p><h2>Great Houses of Calcutta: Their Antecedents, Precedents, Splendour and Portents</h2><p>The mansions of North Kolkata described in Great Houses of Calcutta were built by the cream of the indigenous elite during the city's colonial era. Some exceptions apart, these are now largely forlorn reminders of the ways of life, aspirations and aesthetic values of the wealthy Indian land owners, bankers and traders who flourished during the heyday of the city's colonial era of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The houses are an important part of the urban and architectural history of Kolkata and are past representatives of the ongoing debate over what it means to be modern while representing a living culture in built form.

Commissioned by land speculators, local businesses, civic organizations, and individual citizens, these renderings fostered both civic pride and local commerce. The use of color lithography, a recent invention popularized by such prominent publishers as Currier &amp; Ives, allowed the inexpensive reproduction of the highest-quality drawings, so that a bird's eye view was within the financial budget of even the smallest towns. These extraordinarily detailed lithographs eventually numbered in the thousands and now serve as a rich pictorial record of North America as it stood a century ago. <br>This sequel to our highly acclaimed title <i>An Atlas of Rare City Maps</i> collects over 100 views dating between 1835 and 1902, showing the streets, buildings, churches, bridges, waterways, and surrounding countryside of North American towns, ranging from burgeoning metropolitan centers to small logging towns and mining camps. Baltimore, Brooklyn, Denver, Indianapolis, Memphis, Montreal, New Orleans, Pittsburgh, Seattle, Syracuse, and Washington are just a few of the cities presented in this collection. The exquisite color and fine detail of these bird's eye views have been reproduced in all their original glory; also included is an introduction by John W. Reps providing a background on the artistic process and on urban development in the nineteenth century.</p><p>John W. Reps is professor emeritus of city and regional planning at Cornell University.

This book tells the story of the sometimes painful birth of the modern war correspondent."-Dan Rather, CBS News<br> <br> "Civil War reporters were a colorful breed: rough, rowdy, courageous, competitive-occasionally even accurate. Jim Perry, a great reporter himself, recognizes these bohemian adventurers and brings them vividly to life in this entertaining and eye-opening look at the men who crafted the rough draft of our history."-Tony Horwitz, author of Confederates in the Attic: Dispatches from the Unfinished Civil War<br> <br> "A Bohemian Brigade is a joyous account of a time when reporters did not take themselves seriously-nor did anyone else-written by one of the great reporters of his generation."-Sander Vanocur, The History Channel</p><p>A familiar figure on the modern battlefield is the combat correspondent, that hard-bitten, cynical journalist who chews on cigars and bullets and brings the smoke and gore back home. So the stereotype goes--and with basis in fact, as historian James Perry shows in this vigorous history of reporters on the front lines of the American Civil War.<p> Perry begins his narrative with the Crimean War, when the remarkable William Howard Russell sent dispatches of bungling and destruction to eager readers in London. When Russell, a larger-than-life character, strapped on his pistols and set sail from England to cover the outbreak of the American Civil War, he found that his fame had preceded him--and that he'd spawned many imitators. Newspapers North and South raced to scoop each other for the big stories of the day, fielding reporters who sought to outdo Russell at his own game.</p><p> Perry centers his narrative on a comparative handful of these homegrown journalists, whose work entailed constant danger on both sides of the line--bullets from the front, suspicious generals ever ready to charge the reporters with espionage on the rear. Most of the journalists acquitted themselves well in their work, although some were inclined to florid prose and not particularly troubled with questions of accuracy. Quoting extensively from the dispatches of those battlefield writers, good and bad, Perry examines their role in shaping American journalism--after the Civil War, the reading public demanded eyewitness accounts instead of canned official releases--and public opinion throughout an era of cataclysm. With <i>A Bohemian Brigade</i>, Perry adds a useful, and highly readable, footnote to our understanding of the era. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>Much of our understanding of the American Civil War is based upon newspaper dispatches written under horrific battlefield conditions, and journalists&#x2019; memoirs penned under more reflective moments after the war&#x2019;s end. A Bohemian Brigade is the masterful account of the true nature of combat correspondence&#x2014;its probable accuracy and ultimate accountability&#x2014;during the Civil War years. In this even-handed survey, James M. Perry examines a civil war, a free press, and the inevitable impact each had on the other. Focusing on the self-proclaimed "bohemian brigade"&#x2014;whom General William Sherman vilified as "the buzzards of the press"&#x2014;Perry assesses the performance of a ragtag band whose professional descendants remain controversial to this day. The tales Perry tells are entertaining, sometimes hard to believe, but always historically accurate. Competition led reporters to file stories prematurely as they raced to be the first to get their account on the "the lightning"&#x2014;their name for the telegraph. The headline of the New York Herald on July 22, 1861, erroneously proclaimed the Union Army&#x2019;s rout at the first battle of Bull Run a "Brilliant Union Victory!" Army commanders on both sides distrusted a free press they could not control. Thomas Knox&#x2019;s critical accounts of Union campaigning at Vicksburg so provoked General Sherman that he ordered a court-martial to prosecute this civilian reporter as a spy! Yet the press also made invaluable contributions to each side&#x2019;s cause. For instance, neither army had any procedure for publishing casualty lists. After a battle, reporters would collect the names of the dead and wounded. At times, their efforts became heroic. Bradley Osbon, an experienced seaman, covered the Union&#x2019;s capture of New Orleans by signing aboard fleet officer David G. Farragut&#x2019;s flagship, the Hartford, as a clerk. Upon learning of Osbon&#x2019;s maritime exploits in the Far East from Osbon himself, Farragut promoted the reporter to the rank of fleet signal officer. And in reporting General Ulysses S. Grant&#x2019;s engagement against General Robert E. Lee at the battle of the Wilderness, reporter Henry Wing also delivered a personal message from Grant to his commander in chief, President Abraham Lincoln: "Whatever happens, there is to be no turning back." Lincoln kissed the reporter on the forehead for relaying these stirring words of hope. With a dry wit and keen eye for detail honed by his four decades of journalistic experiences, Perry provides a fresh understanding of how the reporting of a war can affect the trajectory of war itself.</p><h2>Alaska Crude: Visions of the Last Frontier</h2><p>152p large format paperback with b/w photographs throughout, pages clean, binding firm, some mild discolouring to front board</p><p></p><h2>Waiting for the Man: The Life &amp; Career of Lou Reed</h2><p>In Waiting For The Man, Jeremy Reed focuses on Lou Reed as rock&#39;s principal literary avatar, paying special attention to his controversial lyrics and prototypical garage sound.

He seems a very unlikely Communist, but before the hearing is concluded he has disappeared - defected to the East - though not before the chief witness has committed &#39;suicide&#39;. 19 years later his son, Nick, receives a message that his father wants to see him in Prague. His first reaction is rejection and denial, but his memories and curiosity combined with a deep attraction for the messenger persuade him to risk the journey only a year after the Russian invasion. He discovers his father to be dying and eager to &#39;come home&#39;. He learns too that the events preceding Walter&#39;s defection were not as simplistic as he&#39;d thought, but before he can really work out what had happened his father is dead, probably murdered. Sure now that his father is more victim than villain, Nick knows he can only prove this in America, but he is stuck in a country where rules of evidence and justice are ignored and getting out is not going to be straightforward ...</p><p>Boyd Gaines (<i>The Heidi Chronicles</i>, <i>She Loves Me</i>) reads <i>The Prodigal Spy</i> in a smooth, even baritone, spouting off sentences with the ease and charm of television game-show host. What's more, his renditions of a McCarthyesque congressman, a sassy young journalist, and a Czech American defector--to name a few--are a treat to hear; not to mention his female impersonations, which would make Terence Stamp from <i>Priscilla, Queen of the Desert</i> envious. A master storyteller and consummate ham, Gaines's award-winning acting shines through, making this edition highly entertaining.

The trouble with history, Nick Kotlar's father tells him, is that you have to live through it before you know how it'll come out. And for Walter Kotlar, a high-level State Department official, the stakes couldn't be higher: an ambitious Congressman has accused him of treason. As nick watches helplessly, his family's privileged world is turned upside down in a frenzy of klieg lights and banging gavels. Then one snowy night the chief witness against his father plunges to her death and his father flees, leaving only an endless mystery and the stain of his defection. It would be better, Nick is told, to think of him as dead.</p><p>But twenty years later Walter Kotlar is still alive, and he enlists Molly, a young journalist, to bring Nick a disturbing message. He badly wants to see his son; after two decades of silence and isolation, he is desperate to end his own Cold War. Resentful but intrigued, Nick agrees to accompany Molly to Soviet-occupied Czechoslovakia for the painful reunion.</p><p>Once in Prague, Nick finds a clandestine world where nothing is what it seems--not the beautiful city, shadowy with menace; not the woman with whom he falls in love; and most of all not the man he thinks he no longer knows, yet still knows better than anyone. For Walter Kotlar has an impossible request: he wants to come home and he wants Nick to help. He also has a valuable secret about what really happened the night he walked out of Nick's life--and about the deadly conspiracy that still threatens them.</p><p>The Prodigal Spy is a story of fathers and sons and the loyalties that transcend borders, and of a young man's search for the truth buried in his own past, when a national drama was made personal and history itself became a crime story. Like Los Alamos, this is at once an ingenious mystery, a love story, and a masterly recreation of an era whose <br>legacy haunts our own.</p></p><h2>Talking To Dragons (Magicquest)</h2><p>Young Daystar sets out on a journey in search of his heritage to find the lair of the King of the Dragons and stumbles upon a war between fire-breathing dragons and magical wizards</p><p>ll cast<br>approx. 5.5 hours<br>4 cassettes<br><br>Daystar has never seen his mother, Cimorene, actually perform magic.

Yet he inwardly rebels against the totalitarian world he lives in, which demands absolute obedience and controls him through the all-seeing telescreens and the watchful eye of Big Brother, symbolic head of the Party. In his longing for truth and liberty, Smith begins a secret love affair with a fellow-worker Julia, but soon discovers the true price of freedom is betrayal.</p><p>"Outside, even through the shut window pane, the world looked cold. Down in the street little eddies of wind were whirling dust and torn paper into spirals, and though the sun was shining and the sky a harsh blue, there seemed to be no color in anything except the posters that were plastered everywhere."<p> The year is 1984; the scene is London, largest population center of Airstrip One.</p><p> Airstrip One is part of the vast political entity Oceania, which is eternally at war with one of two other vast entities, Eurasia and Eastasia. At any moment, depending upon current alignments, all existing records show either that Oceania has always been at war with Eurasia and allied with Eastasia, or that it has always been at war with Eastasia and allied with Eurasia. Winston Smith knows this, because his work at the Ministry of Truth involves the constant "correction" of such records. "'Who controls the past,' ran the Party slogan, 'controls the future: who controls the present controls the past.'"</p><p> In a grim city and a terrifying country, where Big Brother is always Watching You and the Thought Police can practically read your mind, Winston is a man in grave danger for the simple reason that his memory still functions. He knows the Party's official image of the world is a fluid fiction. He knows the Party controls the people by feeding them lies and narrowing their imaginations through a process of bewilderment and brutalization that alienates each individual from his fellows and deprives him of every liberating human pursuit from reasoned inquiry to sexual passion. Drawn into a forbidden love affair, Winston finds the courage to join a secret revolutionary organization called The Brotherhood, dedicated to the destruction of the Party. Together with his beloved Julia, he hazards his life in a deadly match against the powers that be.</p><p> <i>Newspeak</i>, <i>doublethink</i>, <i>thoughtcrime</i>--in <i>1984</i>, George Orwell created a whole vocabulary of words concerning totalitarian control that have since passed into our common vocabulary. More importantly, he has portrayed a chillingly credible dystopia.

While this is typically attributed to climate change and habitat destruction, few people realize that there is a direct link to consumer demand for cheap meat.</p><p> Some may see intensive farming as a necessary evil. After all, we need to produce more food for a growing global population and are led to believe that squeezing animals into factory farms and growing crops in vast, chemical-soaked prairies is efficient and leaves land free for wildlife--but this is far from the truth. With the limits of the planet's resources now seemingly within touching distance, awareness is growing about how the wellbeing of society depends on a thriving natural world.

When he awoke next morning, there&#x2019;d be a tiny honey cake beside his bowl of gruel, and he&#x2019;d give himself one bite each day until it was gone. The previous year, he&#x2019;d managed to make it last near a week.<br> <br>Midnight was clear and bright, with a hint of summer in the spring, and the headstones glowed like a mouthful of teeth under the moon. This was a messy business in the rain, so at least there was that. Thomas&#x2019;s fingers curled around the shovel&#x2019;s handle as he looked back and forth across the plots, waiting for one to speak to him, just as he&#x2019;d been taught.<br> <br>When he was smaller, it&#x2019;d been Thomas&#x2019;s job to keep watch, eyes and ears peeled for anyone who might have it in mind to stop them. There&#x2019;d been some close ones, but nobody&#x2019;d ever caught them.<br> <br>But for a while now, Thomas&#x2019;d been old enough to dig.<br> <br>Behind him, his father waited. Waited to see if Thomas &#x201c;had the bones.&#x201d; That&#x2019;s what Silas Marsden called it, the sense of knowing which grave might hold the plunder that would feed them, keep the tallow candles burning another while.<br> <br>The yew trees cast shadows of tall, dark ghosts waving gnarled arms and shaking wild, leafy heads. Stars peered through, bright, watching eyes, blinking in horror at the desecration that was about to come.<br> <br>But stars knew nothing of empty bellies and grates with no coal. Stars always had fire.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hurry up, then,&#x201d; grizzled Silas. &#x201c;Find your bones, or I will.&#x201d;<br> <br>That wouldn&#x2019;t do. Silas was always just a bit more generous when Thomas did the work&#x2014;and happier to have someone else to blame if they caught a dud.<br> <br>Thomas turned this way and that, and froze.<br> <br>&#x201c;D&#x2019;you hear something?&#x201d; he asked. Footsteps, he was almost sure of it. The very particular sound of footsteps trying not to make any noise.<br> <br>Tap, tap, tap, on the soft grass between the graves.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t &#x2019;ear nothing. If I didn&#x2019;t know better, I&#x2019;d think you was frightened. Not frightened, are you, son?&#x201d;<br> <br>Thomas straightened his shoulders. He most certainly was not. Perhaps it was nothing. Trees or an animal. He never felt alone in graveyards, anyway.<br> <br>&#x201c;This way,&#x201d; he said, starting in the opposite direction from whence the possibly imagined footsteps had gone. Shovels over shoulders, they trudged along the paths, sacks in their hands, which would hopefully soon be filled.<br> <br>Beyond the graveyard walls, the lively, stinking city felt very far away, banished by this land of the dead. Thomas dropped his sack and shovel beside a crumbling stone on which he could just make out the name COSGROVE because Mam had insisted he learn his letters.<br> <br>In this work, there was always a choice to be made. Older graves might&#x2019;ve been turned over already, their treasures taken, but for those as were untouched, what they held could be worth a whole handful of coin. Newer ones were a safe bet for a few bits and bobs, but rare was the one that&#x2019;d feed them for a month.<br> <br>The digging itself was no easy job. Sweaty and back-breaking and endless, the blades of the shovels chewing up the earth and diving in for another mouthful, only to spit it out onto a growing hill beside the growing hole. When their arms would no longer reach&#x2014;sooner for Thomas than his father&#x2014;Thomas would jump lightly into the grave and try not to think of what was beneath his feet.<br> <br>And then there was a moment, there was always a moment, when metal struck wood and Thomas could loosen his blistered fingers from the handle, for they were almost finished. This was also the moment when the stench began to waft, a smell of sickness and decay. Thomas covered his nose with a ragged shirtsleeve that, truth be told, didn&#x2019;t smell much better.<br> <br>Rotted wood splintered under a final blow, and again when Silas climbed down to pull the coffin&#x2019;s lid free of its rusted hinges.<br> <br>&#x201c;Not bad,&#x201d; he muttered. &#x201c;Not so bad at all. This&#x2019;ll fetch a bit from the right buyer if it&#x2019;s polished up right nice.&#x201d; A silver brush, its bristles long since fallen away to dust, gleamed in his hand. Thomas tried quite hard not to look at the spot it had come from, right between two hands that were nothing but bone now, but he could never resist completely.<br> <br>The whole body was nothing but bone, bone and gaps for mouth and nose, ears and eyes. Two silver coins had fallen with unheard clunks to the wood below at some point after it had been buried and forgotten.<br> <br>&#x201c;Reckon you can keep one of those,&#x201d; said Thomas&#x2019;s father, as was his way. He was not, by and large, a cruel man, and always gave Thomas a small share of the spoils if Thomas helped. A bigger share, if Thomas chose, and chose well. Most times, Thomas slipped it into his mother&#x2019;s purse so she might return from market with a few extra morsels.<br> <br>The brush, a music box, the other coin, and a pair of shoe buckles went into a sack. Not bad for a night. Thomas climbed from the grave, his father behind, and they made quick work of filling it back up from the mountain of earth. Oh, by the light of day it would be clear that someone had disturbed the plot, but by then they would be long gone.<br> <br>&#x201c;Got time for another.&#x201d; The moon still shone high in the sky.<br> <br>Soon they wouldn&#x2019;t, as the days grew longer and warmer and stole the darkness that shrouded them. Winter was best. They scarcely had to wait past suppertime, but on those bitter cold days when the ground was frozen solid, it oftentimes took a whole night to dig just one.<br> <br>Thomas led them deeper into the graveyard, almost to the wall that surrounded it, and near clapped with glee. A fresh one, so new as to not even have a marker yet, no name to read or years at which to wonder. The digging was so much easier when they was fresh, too, the earth loose and unsettled, welcoming the body back into its embrace.<br> <br>&#x201c;An easy one, eh? Good job.&#x201d; Thomas&#x2019;s father patted his shoulder with a calloused hand. The objects in the sack clattered together as it hit the ground, and they both readied their shovels.<br> <br>They did not have to dig far.<br> <br>And there was no wood to splinter.<br> <br>A scant few feet down, Thomas&#x2019;s shovel struck something that was surely not a coffin.<br> <br>&#x201c;What in blazes&#x2014;? Careful!&#x201d;<br> <br>Thomas dropped to his knees and began to brush the earth away with his hands. The corpse was new, plump and cool, the cloth that covered it whole and perfect. Worms and critters hadn&#x2019;t gotten to it yet.<br> <br>He swept the last of the dirt from the face, and his blood ran colder than the skin under his fingers. And then, as if it would make some sort of difference, he scooped the earth from the rest of the body in great, messy handfuls. It made no difference at all, no good one, and a dozen feelings all choked in Thomas&#x2019;s throat like a chicken bone, for looking at the body was like . . . like staring into a pond on a clear day.<br> <br>When Silas Marsden had told Thomas to &#x201c;find his bones,&#x201d; this was not what was meant, but it might as well have been. In the grave, smeared with earth on skin not covered by a black robe, was Thomas himself, down to the ragged fingernails, the blemish on his cheek, there in a shard of looking glass since Thomas could remember.<br> <br>Silas Marsden whispered a prayer.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>There was not a single difference, so far as Thomas could see. True, he was not covered in earth, and his skin was warmer than the soil-smeared face below him, but those things weren&#x2019;t as important as the ones that were exactly the same. The face, the hands, the skinny chest when Silas parted the robe with the end of his shovel. Despite the strangeness before them, it seemed he couldn&#x2019;t resist the urge to make sure there was nothing of value under the cloth.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t understand,&#x201d; said Thomas. &#x201c;It looks just like me. Why does it look just like me?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We bury it again,&#x201d; snapped his father, ignoring Thomas&#x2019;s question, seeming to answer a different one as he looked up at the stars. &#x201c;Doesn&#x2019;t have nothing to take. We bury it again and get out of &#x2019;ere. Come on, quick.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Do as I say, or feel the back of my hand, boy!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But it does have something!&#x201d; said Thomas, startled. Silas had never struck him, not when he spilled his supper or broke a mug or put holes in his jumpers, and he knew many who were not so fortunate. Silas was afraid, a thing so unfamiliar to Thomas it took him a heartbeat to see it for what it was.<br> <br>But he couldn&#x2019;t do as Silas asked, for Silas was wrong. Thomas pulled free the curl of paper from under the cold fingers that were otherwise identical to his own, and a shiver passed through him, as, briefly, he held his own hand.<br> <br>Silas peered at it in the moonlight. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s it say? Read those letters your mam&#x2019;s made you learn. Never saw any call for that, meself.&#x201d;<br> <br>The ink was so blue it was almost black, formed into whorls and spikes. At first look, they seemed nothing like the letters Mam had painstakingly taught him, sounding each one out and stringing them together into words. He squinted as the shapes seemed to wriggle and change.<br> <br>&#x201c;It says, My name is Thistle,&#x201d; Thomas whispered. What an odd name. And what an odd feeling it was that came over Thomas, a wave of despair and fright from the boy at his feet, as clear as if the boy could talk and had whispered to Thomas that he was sad and afraid. Odd. But there was nothing about this that wasn&#x2019;t odd, and the name wasn&#x2019;t the only thing the note said.<br> <br>Do not read this aloud. Go. Wear a cap. Watch. Speak to no one. This is essential.<br> <br>Three more bits of paper had fallen to the ground. Thomas gathered them up, and these were printed in ordinary letters. He&#x2019;d seen something like them once before, when the graves had been particularly rich and Mam had taken him to a penny theater as a treat.<br> <br>Those tickets hadn&#x2019;t been made of such thick card, however, with gold leaf around the edges. The theater hadn&#x2019;t been in such a posh part of town as the address on these, neither.<br> <br>The performance was the following night.<br> <br>&#x201c;This is all some daft trick,&#x201d; said Silas, gripping his shovel tighter, the distraction over. &#x201c;Get to work.&#x201d;<br> <br>Thomas slipped the note and the tickets into his pocket.<br> <br>Calluses burned on Thomas&#x2019;s palm. He tipped the first load of earth slowly back into the hole, where it covered the face so like his own. Another shovel of dirt, slowly again. But his pace did not matter, for Silas Marsden worked as if possessed, scooping up huge clumps and throwing them into the grave, breath labored and loud in the quiet night.<br> <br>He did not say another word to Thomas, not when they had finished, nor on the long trudge home, nor when he pushed open the creaking door and pointed in the direction of Thomas&#x2019;s small bed, really no more than a pile of moth-eaten blankets near the hearth.<br> <br>If there was coal, Mam always left a few embers glowing for the bit of warmth that stole over Thomas as he climbed under the topmost blanket&#x2014;the thinnest and most threadbare. The others formed a nest underneath him that softened the hard floor. Most nights he was weary, tired to his very bones from hours in the graveyards, and grateful to fall asleep soon as he was burrowed in, but not this night.<br> <br>Tonight his bones in this bed couldn&#x2019;t be as tired as his bones in the grave, so exhausted they would never move again.<br> <br>It simply made no sense, not the slightest bit. The Robertsons down the road and round the corner, they had two girls, twins, who looked so much the same that Thomas couldn&#x2019;t tell which was waving to him in the street. But Mam and Papa had never so much as hinted at Thomas having a brother. He longed to ask his father, longed right up until the moment Silas Marsden finished hanging up coats and shovels on the nails by the door and stomped across the room in socks badly in need of darning. The door to the house&#x2019;s one other room slammed shut hard enough to wake Mam, asleep on the other side.<br> <br>Sure enough, voices slipped like smoke through the cracks around the wood. Whispers, and they got no louder even when Thomas crept from his bed to press his ear against the rough, splintery planks. The floor was cold under his toes, drafts breathed across his neck, but Thomas did not move except to sit when his legs would no longer hold him.<br> <br>When Thomas woke, he was in his bed, warm, the fire ablaze in the hearth. A long spoon clanged on the side of a metal pot hung over the flames on a hook.<br> <br>&#x201c;Wake up. That&#x2019;s your breakfast ready,&#x201d; said Thomas&#x2019;s mother. &#x201c;Come now, eat.&#x201d; She looked tired, great dark circles under her eyes, but she was smiling as always. Her hair curled in wisps over her shawl.<br> <br>&#x201c;In the graveyard&#x2014;&#x201d; Thomas began, remembering.<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s clean water. Wash your hands, as I can guess you didn&#x2019;t before bed, and I won&#x2019;t have you getting my spoons mucky. Those as has an &#x2019;undred of them can get them as filthy as they likes, but not in this home, I say.&#x201d;<br> <br>Perhaps she would let him ask his questions if he did as he was bade. This was quite often the case with Mam, who got more kindly with each completed chore. Thomas had learned this very young.<br> <br>He wrested himself from the nest of blankets, which had become nearly too hot under the wash of warmth from the blazing fire and dipped his hands into the bucket in the corner. Too cold. Everything was always either too warm or too cold, usually the latter. His gruel this morning burned his tongue, though, and Thomas was sure Mam had cooked it much longer than usual as he&#x2019;d slept. The honey cake sat in a chipped dish, but Thomas had more important things to think about.<br> <br>&#x201c;Last night&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>Thomas&#x2019;s mother began to whistle as she scrubbed the shelves that held their cups and bowls.<br> <br>She told him off for whistling. Said it was rude.<br> <br>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;s Papa?&#x201d;<br> <br>Finally, Lucy Marsden met Thomas&#x2019;s eyes. &#x201c;Gone out,&#x201d; she said, knuckles clenched white around the rag in her fist. &#x201c;Said &#x2019;e&#x2019;d be back soon, and that there&#x2019;d be a bit of pie for us to have for lunch. I know as you both found something strange last night, but I won&#x2019;t discuss it, not without your&#x2014;not without Silas &#x2019;ere. So you be a good boy and do today&#x2019;s lesson, and we&#x2019;ll just wait.&#x201d;<br> <br>Thomas knew two things: that there was something he wasn&#x2019;t being told, and that Mam, having made her mind up good and proper, wouldn&#x2019;t tell him no matter how he begged.<br> <br>So he&#x2019;d had a brother once. Surely that was it. A brother down to an identical birthmark, and even the Robertson girls didn&#x2019;t have those, far as Thomas knew. Not that he&#x2019;d ever asked, or had reason to.<br> <br>It wasn&#x2019;t so odd, really, to foster out a child. Where would another have slept in this house? On the nights there was no food at all, even bread or old potatoes filched from the barrow-man, one less mouth to feed must&#x2019;ve seemed a blessing.<br> <br>But now his brother was in a grave, and an empty, uneasy feeling slithered through Thomas from his belly to his fingers and toes.<br> <br>It was the nature of the Marsden business, if it could be called a business, that Thomas had seen far more than his fair share of cold, unbreathing bodies and skeletons rottin...</p><h2>Architecture in Cincinnati: An Illustrated History of Designing and Building an American City</h2><p>Cincinnati was the first &#x201c;great&#x201d; city founded afterAmerican independence, and its prodigious growth reflected the rise of the new nation.

"Our objective was to bring together the first chronological survey of Cincinnati's architecture, telling local history as the built environment reflects it," she says. "We each brought a slightly different perspective."<br><br>&nbsp;Beth Sullebarger, historic preservation consultant; Jayne Merkel, architectural historian and critic; and Alice Weston, environmental photographer, also contributed to the book. John E. Hancock, professor of architecture at the University of Cincinnati, served as editorial advisor.<br><br>&nbsp;Cincinnati's architecture lends itself to an historical approach with ease, this being a city that grew immensely in its early years. Cincinnati began to equate progress and culture with its buildings as it matured and, despite some unconsidered destruction, has preserved important portions of its heritage.<br><br>&nbsp;Meanwhile, new elements have come into being. More for better than worse, Cincinnati was the first major city to establish a Master Plan, in 1925, and was guided by it for 20 years, when a new plan went into place. Recognizing that a city is never independent from its surroundings, the book's scope extends to the immediate region on both sides of the river.<br><br>&nbsp;Painter, for more than a decade a public historian for the Cincinnati Historical Society, is the author of the book's first six chapters, covering historical material into the 20th century. Chapter headings tell the story in abridged fashion, beginning with "Frontier City to Regional Capital, 1788-1829," touching on "Queen of the West, 1830-60" and continuing through to "Modernism and Reform in City Building, 1920-33."<br><br>&nbsp;Sullebarger then takes over with "The Depression Era, 1933-44," bringing us up to today's world in the final chapter, "Dynamic Mix of New and Old, 1989-2006." In an interesting aside relevant to a city proud of its parks, she tells us about architectural styles in park structures. Merkel augments this latter section with a lively chapter titled "Toward the Bicentennial, New Versus Old, 1964-88."<br><br>&nbsp;Throughout the book Weston's luminous photographs show us where we are now and are supplemented from the copious collection of the Cincinnati Historical Society. Painter thanks her former colleagues at the Society for their help in locating images not previously published, and also historian Dan Hurley and architectural historian Walter Langsam, each of whom critiqued the manuscript. Langsam's extensive research on 19th-century buildings and architects, in particular, was a prime information source.<br><br>&nbsp;Interestingly, the story doesn't begin with that handful of settlers who struggled up the bank at Yeatman's Cove in December of 1788 but with the Native Americans who built here hundreds of years before. Indian mounds -- there once was one where Fountain Square stands -- were endlessly fascinating to its first European-stock inhabitants.<br><br>&nbsp;With our generously bestowing the Genius of the Water Fountain once again in place, it is telling to discover we have previously and regularly carped about her surroundings and set about to correct them. "The dingy blocks" around the Fountain's first location, an esplanade in the middle of Fifth Street, were eventually spruced up, and we have since provided first one and then another civic square to set her off. This is appropriate, as the Fountain -- one of the first public fountain sculptures in the country -- was a catalyst for a new way of thinking about art and architecture for the city, Painter writes, and has always provided a distinguishing focal point for civic life.<br><br>&nbsp;The book reflects our shared environment, with housing represented mostly in the aggregate. Even for those familiar with the city's architectural history, the approach here gives new insight to our surroundings.<br><br>Architecture in Cincinnati is readable and well illustrated, with appropriate scholarly accoutrements of notes, bibliography and good index supporting its generally upbeat look at the city. Cincinnati bashers should steer clear. They might end up liking the place after all.

Her books include <i>If the Slipper Fits </i>and <i>Stroke of Midnight</i>.</p><i>Chapter 1</i> <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>&#x201c;This is a travesty,&#x201d; said Walt Stratham, Viscount Greaves. &#x201c;I demand a rematch at once.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll discuss the matter in private.&#x201d; Noting the curious glances from several club members in the corridor, Damien Burke ushered the irate man into his study and closed the door. <br>The spacious chamber featured a claw-footed desk on a Persian rug, the finest that money could buy. At this late hour, the tall windows showed pinpricks of light against the darkness of the city. The scent of leather bindings came from the bookcase behind the desk. On the opposite wall, a gently hissing fire warded off the February chill. <br>No expense had been spared on the d�cor. Damien had fought long and hard to acquire the trappings of the upper crust. While his fellow Eton graduates had inherited their wealth, he had started out with nothing. He had accrued his own fortune, first by his skill at gambling, and then by prudent investments in shipping, property, and this club. <br>With ruthless resolve, he had built Demon&#x2019;s Den into the most fashionable gaming site in London. Here, gold flowed freely from the pockets of the aristocrats into his coffers. If the nobility barred him from their drawing rooms, then by God, he would make them pay for the privilege of occupying <i>his</i> establishment. <br>In particular, this man. <br>Ignoring the pair of chairs by the hearth, Damien strolled to the desk, took a brown leather pouch from his pocket, and tossed it onto the polished surface. The ivory counters inside made a satisfying clink. <br>The viscount glowered at the sack. No wonder. The sum of his losses represented a full five years&#x2019; worth of his quarterly allowance from his father, the Earl of Pennington. The earl had a reputation as a harsh, miserly man. With the expense of launching a daughter into society in the coming season, Lord Pennington wouldn&#x2019;t be amenable to making loans to his profligate eldest son. <br>Walt faced a grim future hounded by creditors. Not even his status as heir to an earldom would save him. His only recourse would be to agree to the terms that Damien would present to him in a moment. <br>But first, Damien wanted to savor his victory. <br>He purposely took his time opening the sack. Walt had changed little since their school days; he still exuded the inborn superiority of the upper class. But now the hazel eyes beneath a thatch of ginger hair revealed a telltale trace of panic. Over the years Damien had taught himself to read the nuances of mannerisms that betrayed a man&#x2019;s thoughts. A slight tic or nervous gesture, a tapping of the fingers or the lifting of an eyebrow, all served as clues to the cards in his hands. <br>Damien had employed that talent tonight to reel in his prey. He had craved this moment for over fifteen years. However, unlike the hotheaded schoolboy he had once been, he kept his expression cool and his emotions disciplined. <br>He poured the little discs into a heap on the desk and began to stack them into neat piles. He didn&#x2019;t really need to add up the counters; he already knew the precise amount of his winnings. Rather, the action was designed to further fray Walt&#x2019;s nerves. <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s time to settle your debt,&#x201d; Damien stated. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s paper and pen for you to write a bank draft to me.&#x201d; <br>Walt made no move to avail himself of the quill and inkpot placed at the corner of the desk. He elevated his chin to a disdainful angle. &#x201c;The devil you say! If you were a gentleman, you&#x2019;d grant me the chance to win back my funds.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid that wasn&#x2019;t our agreement. It was winner take all.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Only because I thought&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You thought I&#x2019;d be an easy mark.&#x201d; <i>Just as I was at Eton</i>. Damien had been small for his age back then, alone in the world, a charity student among the hordes of privileged boys from the best families. <br>Walt nervously gripped the lapels of his forest-green coat. &#x201c;This is your club. You must have rigged the game.&#x201d; <br>Damien gave him a caustic smile. Walt had always been quick to blame his own failings on others, particularly those he considered to be his social inferiors. He would never have dared to fling such an insulting accusation at a fellow gentleman. As much as Damien would have liked to avenge the slur with his fists, he knew that violence would be antithetical to his purpose. <br>&#x201c;I allowed <i>you</i> to deal each hand,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;So if there was any cheating at all, it must have been done by <i>you</i>.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;What blather! You marked the cards somehow.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;And you inspected the deck before the game commenced. Now, enough of your excuses.&#x201d; Damien nudged the paper and pen toward him. &#x201c;Write the bank draft.&#x201d; <br>Walt shifted from one foot to the other. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s no point,&#x201d; he said sullenly. &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t sufficient funds in my account.&#x201d; <br>They were making headway, at least, since he appeared to have abandoned his false accusation of cheating. He would soon realize that Damien had no interest in fleecing Walt. <br>At least not of his money. <br>Damien strolled to the chair behind the desk. &#x201c;Ask your father for a loan, then.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Absolutely not! He despises gambling.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Indeed? Then it seems you&#x2019;re in quite the quandary.&#x201d; <br>Walt groped for the quill and jammed the sharpened tip into the silver inkpot. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll write you an IOU if I must,&#x201d; he said through gritted teeth. &#x201c;That will have to suffice.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No. I&#x2019;m afraid it won&#x2019;t. Let me be perfectly clear. I will have my payment before the week is out.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Blast you!&#x201d; Walt tossed down the pen so that black ink spattered the paper. &#x201c;If you intend for me to sign my soul over to some dodgy moneylender, think again!&#x201d; <br>Damien seated himself in the desk chair and steepled his fingers beneath his chin. The time had come to get an answer to the question burning inside him. &#x201c;Very well,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Since you have no funds, I&#x2019;ll allow you to repay me in another way.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;How? Tell me.&#x201d; <br>The hint of desperate hope in the man&#x2019;s voice gratified Damien. &#x201c;You have something of mine in your possession. If you return it, I&#x2019;ll forgive the entire debt.&#x201d; <br>Walt frowned. &#x201c;Something of <i>yours</i>? Why, I&#x2019;ve scarcely seen you since we left Eton over ten years ago.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You stole it from me while we were at school. If you rack your brain, perhaps you&#x2019;ll recall the incident.&#x201d; <br>Damien certainly did. The memories of that long-ago time burned like a canker inside him. An impoverished orphan, he had been taunted and bullied by the other boys. Perhaps his situation wouldn&#x2019;t have been so dire had he hailed from a highborn family that had fallen on hard times. But his ancestry had been&#x2014;and still was&#x2014;an utter mystery. <br> <i>A matronly woman he&#x2019;d called Mimsy had raised him in a tiny flat in the London borough of Southwark. Mrs. Mims had taught him proper speech along with a rigorous slate of academic lessons. Perhaps that was why, even as a small boy, Damien sensed he was different. He didn&#x2019;t fit in with the scruffy, unschooled children who ran free in the neighborhood. At times, Mimsy hinted that his father had royal blood. She spun tales of princely heroes slaying dragons and told him that he, too, must always be brave. As he grew older, he began to ask questions about his absent parents. Mimsy would offer only a vague story that he&#x2019;d been given to her for safekeeping.</i> <br> <i>If he probed too persistently, her face took on a worried look that soon silenced him. Not even to satisfy his curiosity would he distress Mimsy. She was all he had in the world.</i> <br> <i>One day, they boarded the mail coach to Windsor and visited Eton College, where he sat in a stuffy room and took a long examination with numerous written essays and pages of mathematics problems. Afterward, she consulted with one of the headmasters in an ivy-covered building while Damien waited on the stone steps outside, watching the older boys walk past in chattering groups. They looked posh and unapproachable in their formal garb, making him keenly aware of his own shabby attire. When Mimsy came out, she informed him that he had been accepted as a pupil at the boarding school. He protested vehemently at the notion of being left among strangers, but Mimsy was adamant.</i> <br> <i>Before leaving, she placed a delicate gold chain around his neck. From it dangled a small iron key which he was told to hide beneath his shirt. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been waiting for the right moment to give this to you, my little prince. When I took you in as a babe, it was tucked in your blankets.&#x201d;</i> <br> <i>The key fascinated Damien as he examined it closely. &#x201c;Did it belong to my father?&#x201d; he asked. &#x201c;Where is the lock that it fits?&#x201d;</i> <br> <i>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll learn everything someday. It&#x2019;s all written down in a letter. In the meanwhile, you must guard the key. Never, ever show it to anyone. You&#x2019;re to study hard and make me proud.&#x201d; After a tearful hug and the promise of holiday visits, Mimsy trudged out the school gate.</i> <br> <i>Never to return.</i> <br> <i>Just before Christmas, the headmaster informed Damien that Mrs. Mims had died from a sudden illness. The news was delivered coldly, without a care that Mimsy was the only mother Damien had ever known.</i> <br> <i>After lessons that day, he stole outside so that no one would witness his tears. It was bad enough to be taunted for being a charity pupil without adding &#x201c;sniveling infant&#x201d; to the list of his sins. He sat among the barren rhododendron bushes with his back to the wall of the cloisters. The wintry cold bit through his short coat, and eventually, his grief spent, he scrubbed his sleeve over his damp face.</i> <br> <i>Reaching into his stiff-collared shirt, he drew out the key and traced it with his fingertip. One end had three teeth, the other end a little brass crown stamped into the iron and surrounded by a design of curlicues.</i> <br> <i>With Mimsy gone, this key was the sole link to his past. But she had never explained its significance. Did the crown verify her claim that he had royal blood? Damien wanted to believe it. He wished with all his might that he was a prince with enough riches to draw envy from all the other boys. Perhaps the key opened the door to a treasure room in a castle somewhere.</i> <br> <i>Visions of gold crowns and heaps of glittering jewels filled his imagination. Then another thought absorbed him. Maybe his father, the king, was imprisoned there, waiting for his son to rescue him&nbsp;&#x2026; </i> <br> <i>The scrape of footsteps yanked him out of the fantasy. Damien froze with the key clenched in his fingers.</i> <br> <i>Walt Stratham approached with two of his hulking cronies. From the moment of Damien&#x2019;s arrival, they had singled him out for their tormenting. &#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; Walt called. &#x201c;Is that a necklace you&#x2019;re wearing? You must be a girl in disguise.&#x201d;</i> <br> <i>While the other boys chortled, one of them imitating mincing feminine steps, Damien stuffed the key back inside his shirt. Too late.</i> <br> <i>Walt made a wild grab for the gold chain. &#x201c;Give me that.&#x201d;</i> <br> <i>Damien sprang from the ground in a flurry of punching and kicking. Frantic to protect the precious key, he threw all of his puny strength into the fight. His fist connected with Walt&#x2019;s nose, sending him staggering backward, blood trickling down his face.</i> <br> <i>It was the perfect chance to flee, but a fury born of grief transformed Damien into a wild beast. He lunged at the other two boys. He managed a few quick strikes before the pair of them joined forces to overpower him. They threw him to the rocky ground and held his squirming form in place.</i> <br> <i>In the throes of raw rage, he forgot all caution, shouting, &#x201c;Let me go! I&#x2019;m a prince! My father is a king, and he&#x2019;ll chop off your heads.&#x201d;</i> <br> <i>A moment of stunned silence reigned. Then derisive laughter burst from the trio of boys. &#x201c;King?&#x201d; one jeered. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t even have a father.&#x201d;</i> <br> <i>His nose bloody, Walt bared his teeth in a sneer. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re a filthy bastard.&#x201d; He grabbed the key, snapping its gold chain. &#x201c;Your sire must be the Devil. That&#x2019;s what we&#x2019;ll call you. The Demon Prince.&#x201d;</i> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>&#x201c;Well, Burke? Speak up! Tell me what it is you want from me.&#x201d; <br>Walt&#x2019;s voice dragged Damien back to the present. He sat behind the desk in the private study at his club, facing his longtime nemesis. Viscount Greaves stood with his fists clenched at his sides. His irate hazel eyes betrayed his impatience to settle the gaming debt and be gone. <br>Apparently, Walt didn&#x2019;t remember the incident; it had been only one of their many clashes at Eton before Damien had grown big and strong enough to best any challenger. <br>&#x201c;You took a key from me when I was a first-year,&#x201d; he said tightly. &#x201c;You and two of your mates overpowered me behind the cloisters.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Key?&#x201d; Awareness dawned on Walt&#x2019;s face, followed by a narrowing of his eyes in a guarded expression. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re saying you&#x2019;d erase my losses in exchange for some long-lost trinket? You must be mad.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Nevertheless, you&#x2019;ll bring it to me.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Good God, man, that must have been fifteen years ago! You can&#x2019;t expect me to recall what happened to it. I likely tossed it into a rubbish bin.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;That isn&#x2019;t what you said back then. You used to taunt me that you&#x2019;d put the key where I&#x2019;d never find it.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;So? Wherever it is, I&#x2019;ve forgotten now.&#x201d; <br>As he spoke, Walt averted his gaze. His avoidance of a direct look was a clear indicator of deception. <br>Damien felt his gut tighten with absolute certainty. Walt was lying. He <i>did</i> know the location of the key. <br>&#x201c;It would behoove you to remember, then,&#x201d; Damien said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s your only chance to have your gaming debt forgiven.&#x201d; <br>Walt&#x2019;s resentful gaze slid back. &#x201c;Why do you want a damned key?&#x201d; he asked. &#x201c;Does it fit a strongbox somewhere? It wouldn&#x2019;t surprise me to learn that you were harboring stolen goods even back then.&#x201d; <br>Damien kept his face wiped clean of anger. &#x201c;You <i>will</i> retrieve the key. I&#x2019;ll give you until tomorrow evening to bring it to me.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It might take longer than that,&#x201d; Walt said, a crafty glint entering his eyes. <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t even think to trick me. I remember every detail of that key, and I&#x2019;ll know if it&#x2019;s a forgery.&#x201d; Damien paused for dramatic effect. &#x201c;If you fail to fulfill your end of the bargain, you&#x2019;ll force me to find another means to collect your debt&#x2014;a manner that won&#x2019;t be to your liking.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;What is that supposed to mean?&#x201d; <br>Damien allowed a cold smile. &#x201c;You have a sister about to make her debut. Innocent, sheltered girls are often susceptible to the charms of a dashing stranger.&#x201d; <br>The viscount&#x2019;s face paled so that his freckles stood out. &#x201c;By God! You wouldn&#x2019;t dare go anywhere near Beatrice.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Then do as I say. Bring me that key.&#x201d; <br>Walt&#x2019;s chest heaved beneath his forest-green coat, his nostrils flaring. Abruptly, he slammed his fist onto the desk and rattled the neat stacks of gaming discs. &#x201c;Bastard! You may don the trappings of a gentleman, but you&#x2019;ll always be an upstart from the gutter.&#x201d; <br>Pivoting on his well-shod heel, he threw open the door and stomped out of the study. <br> <i>Bastard</i>. <br>Damien surged up from the chair and stalked to the window to stare out into the night. That word never failed to cause a visceral twist inside him. His ancestry had always been a blank slate. Deep inside him burned the need to give substance to his background. To learn who he really was. Not just for his own sake, but for Lily&#x2019;s. <br>His chest tightened. His daughter was only six years of age, but someday she would ask him questions about her absent grandparents. She would want to know who they were, where they had come from, why they had abandoned him. Mimsy had mentioned a letter that explained everything, presumably from his parents, but he had never been given her...</p><h2>The Nature Of Risk: Stock Market Survival And The Meaning Of Life</h2><p>Mamis--who has been hailed as a &#34;wildly prescient man&#34; by the Milwaukee Business Journal, named to the Wall Street Letter&#39;s 1991 All-American Research Team, and called one of five leading gurus of the stock market by Barron&#39;s--reveals the great paradox of making money in the market: the less you know about a stock or company, the better off you are.</p><p>A veteran Wall Streeter, Mamis argued for technical (as opposed to fundamental) analysis of stock prices in When to Sell (1977) and How to Buy (1982). In the charmingly existential text at hand, however, he goes well beyond his demandingly interpretive discipline to reflect on larger issues. To achieve success in either life or the market, Mamis points out, individuals must act before they know enough, meaning there are hazards involved. He observes, for instance, that investors who hesitate may catch only the last 20% of a bull move and thus assume a disproportionate share of risk. Among other problems, the author notes, those under pressure (i.e., at risk) often let emotion determine their responses. Since experience instills concern as well as confidence, he says, many people (having been coerced into socially acceptable behavior patterns since childhood) become paralyzed at critical junctures in their personal and financial lives. Taking as a given the premise that ``the market climbs a wall of worry,'' Mamis advises readers to trust their intuition (not instincts) whether trading equities, falling in love, or engaging in other more or less gainful pursuits. Incurring informed risks, he asserts, can prove a liberating proposition whose reward is not necessarily a payoff, but a balance. By this, Mamis means the satisfaction that accrues from playing a game (or role) to win, rather than not to lose, from start to finish. In addition to an abundance of Zen-like pronouncements (e.g., ``death is the extreme of risk''; ``like sex, money distorts our senses''), he offers a full measure of contrarian counsel on a wealth of subjects--from gold (a commodity Mamis cites as an impotent hedge during recent market breaks) through indexing (an investment approach that reduces responsibility without curbing risk) and diversification (a system ``designed to protect the dumb''). Thought-provoking perspectives on the market and life as tests that never end. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Born in Winnipeg, Canada, he has spent the past twenty years as a police and military trainer, specializing in the field of Reality Based Training. In the late 1980&#x2019;s, he co-founded SIMUNITION� with David Luxton as an offshoot of the Armiger Corporation in Ottawa, Canada. He subsequently wrote numerous articles and policy papers on the safe conduct of projectile-based simulation training exercises. <p>As the concept of force-on-force training started to gain popularity, he began to study the complexities associated with realistic training. In the wake of the increasing number of serious injuries and deaths that were beginning to occur during tactical simulations, he authored and taught the first instructor schools in North America on how to conduct safe and effective tactical simulations. Since that time, his training principles have been adopted by thousands of agencies, nationally and internationally. He continues to lecture on both a national and international level on the topics Officer Safety and Survival, the Psychology of Lethal Force Encounters, and is regarded as the leading authority on Reality Based. Training. He continues to personally conduct instructor certification schools on Reality Based Training Topics covered in his instructor classes include both the governing principles for effective training as well as the safe use of the broad spectrum of available and emerging technologies designed to improve realism in training for dangerous encounters. Group training and individual consulting to agencies is available to organizations seeking to improve the safety and effectiveness of either their established and existing, or new and developing Reality Based Training programs. </p><p>Along with his contributions to the advancement of training ammunition technologies, Mr. Murray continues to develop innovative training programs and devices designed to improve the effectiveness and safety in other areas of military and law enforcement training through the R&amp;D department of the Armiger Police Training Institute. </p><p>In addition to the training programs taught through the Armiger Police Training Institute, he is an adjunct instructor with the tactical training organization Global Studies Group International, and the international police training organization U.S. Police Instructor Teams. </p><p>His professional affiliations include the International Association of Law Enforcement Firearms Instructors (IALEFI), American Society of Law Enforcement Trainers (ASLET), National Tactical Officers Association (NTOA), California Association of Tactical Officers (CATO), Wisconsin Association of SWAT Personnel (ASP), Florida SWAT Association (FSA), International Association of Bomb Technicians and Investigators (IABTI), International Society of Explosive Engineers (ISEE), and the National Rifle Association (NRA). </p><p>He is an advisor to the Killology Research Group founded by Lt.

The author argues that science has become the &#34;instrument for the callous disregard of man, beasts, plants, and the air we breathe. It has released untold greed for power&#34;. Examining the origins of science in a world permeated by disinterested inquiry, mathematical reason, and the view of nature as a rational whole, the text takes the reader through 500 years, surveying the achievements of Copernicus, Galilieo, Harvey, Newton, Goethe and Einstein. The author points out how science has vastly enabled humanity to gain its control of outer nature while at the same time has diminished inner vision and moral certainty. He argues that people need to wrest their sense of identity away from the cold, mechanistic, computerized world where they are merely another part of nature to be engineered and manipulated.</p><p></p><h2>In from the Cold: Latin America&#x2019;s New Encounter with the Cold War (American Encounters/Global Interactions)</h2><p>Over the last decade, studies of the Cold War have mushroomed globally. Unfortunately, work on Latin America has not been well represented in either theoretical or empirical discussions of the broader conflict. With some notable exceptions, studies have proceeded in rather conventional channels, focusing on U.S. policy objectives and high-profile leaders (Fidel Castro) and events (the Cuban Missile Crisis) and drawing largely on U.S. government sources. Moreover, only rarely have U.S. foreign relations scholars engaged productively with Latin American historians who analyze how the international conflict transformed the region&#x2019;s political, social, and cultural life. Representing a collaboration among eleven North American, Latin American, and European historians, anthropologists, and political scientists, this volume attempts to facilitate such a cross-fertilization. In the process, <i>In From the Cold</i> shifts the focus of attention away from the bipolar conflict, the preoccupation of much of the so-called new Cold War history, in order to showcase research, discussion, and an array of new archival and oral sources centering on the grassroots, where conflicts actually brewed.<p></p><p>The collection&#x2019;s contributors examine international and everyday contests over political power and cultural representation, focusing on communities and groups above and underground, on state houses and diplomatic board rooms manned by Latin American and international governing elites, on the relations among states regionally, and, less frequently, on the dynamics between the two great superpowers themselves. In addition to charting new directions for research on the Latin American Cold War, <i>In From the Cold</i> seeks to contribute more generally to an understanding of the conflict in the global south.</p><p><i>Contributors</i>.

The first in his Detective Inspector Challis murder mystery series, The Dragon Man, won the German Crime Fiction Critics Prize in 2001. Chain of Evidence, another book in the series, won the Ned Kelly Award for best Australian crime novel.*Starred Review* Australian crime fiction flies below the radar of most American fans, but Disher and compatriot Peter Temple are making the case that they deserve to be as well known as Michael Connelly and Ian Rankin. Despite broadening his Inspector Hal Challis series to include Sergeant Ellen Destry, Disher keeps the partners apart for the entire book, each of them solving crimes that share odd resonances. Challis has gone to Mawson's Bluff, his dusty hometown deep in the "never-never," to attend his father's imminent death. Destry, homeless following her sundered marriage, is house-sitting for Challis in lush Waterloo, near Melbourne, and filling in for him at work, too. She is tested by a horrific child abduction, departmental politics, and rogue cops--while he finds himself facing personal history and investigating the long-ago disappearance of his unlikable brother-in-law. There's strong sexual tension between Challis and Destry, despite the fact that they communicate only by phone. This is a procedural, with careful, realistic casework, but the character development suggests Peter Robinson, with enough darkness and ambiguity to suit fans of Rankin, and a kind of which-way-is-up sense of the police force that recalls early James Ellroy. Moody, inventive, and extremely hard to put down. <i>Keir Graff</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

We&#39;re out of oil. We&#39;ve wrecked the climate. Famine, poverty, and disease are widespread. Like most of humanity, Wade Watts escapes this depressing reality by spending his waking hours jacked into the OASIS, a sprawling virtual utopia where you can be anything you want to be, where you can live and play and fall in love on any of ten thousand planets. And like most of humanity, Wade is obsessed by the ultimate lottery ticket that lies concealed within this alternate reality: OASIS founder James Halliday, who dies with no heir, has promised that control of the OASIS - and his massive fortune - will go to the person who can solve the riddles he has left scattered throughout his creation. For years, millions have struggled fruitlessly to attain this prize, knowing only that the riddles are based in the culture of the late twentieth century. And then Wade stumbles onto the key to the first puzzle. Suddenly, he finds himself pitted against thousands of competitors in a desperate race to claim the ultimate prize, a chase that soon takes on terrifying real-world dimensions - and that will leave both Wade and his world profoundly changed.</p><p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, August 2011:</strong> <em>Ready Player One</em> takes place in the not-so-distant future--the world has turned into a very bleak place, but luckily there is OASIS, a virtual reality world that is a vast online utopia. People can plug into OASIS to play, go to school, earn money, and even meet other people (or at least they can meet their avatars), and for protagonist Wade Watts it certainly beats passing the time in his grim, poverty-stricken real life. Along with millions of other world-wide citizens, Wade dreams of finding three keys left behind by James Halliday, the now-deceased creator of OASIS and the richest man to have ever lived. The keys are rumored to be hidden inside OASIS, and whoever finds them will inherit Halliday&#x2019;s fortune. But Halliday has not made it easy. And there are real dangers in this virtual world. Stuffed to the gills with action, puzzles, nerdy romance, and 80s nostalgia, this high energy cyber-quest will make geeks everywhere feel like they were separated at birth from author Ernest Cline.<em>--Chris Schluep</em></p> <strong>Guest Reviewer: Daniel H. Wilson on <em>Ready Player One</em> by Earnest Cline</strong> <br> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <em><strong>Daniel H. Wilson</strong> is the </em>New York Times<em> best-selling author of</em> Robopocalypse. <p>I dare you not to fall in love with <em>Ready Player One</em>. And I mean <em>head over heels</em> in love--the way you fall for someone who is smart, feisty, and who can effortlessly finish your favorite movie lines, music lyrics, or literature quotes before they come out of your mouth.</p> <p><em>Ready Player One</em> expertly mines a copious vein of 1980s pop culture, catapulting the reader on a light-speed adventure in an advanced but backward-looking future.</p> <p>The story is set in a near-term future in which the new, new form of the Internet is a realistic virtual multi-verse called the OASIS. Most human interaction takes place via goggles and gloves in millions of unique worlds, including the boring (and free) &#x201c;public education&#x201d; world from which our teenage protagonist must escape.</p> <p>Our unlikely hero is an overweight trailer park kid who goes by Wade Watts in real life, and &#x201c;Parzival&#x201d; to his best friends and mortal enemies--all of whom he interacts with virtually. Just like the Arthurian knight that is his namesake, young Wade is on a quest for an incredible treasure guarded by mythical creatures. Specifically, the creator of the OASIS and richest man on the planet, James Halliday, stipulated in his will that his fortune be given to the first person who can find an &#x201c;Easter egg&#x201d; hidden somewhere in the OASIS. The catch? Every devilishly complex clue on this treasure hunt is rooted in an intimate knowledge of 1980s pop culture.</p> <p>This leaves the people of the future hilariously <em>obsessed</em> with every aspect of the 1980s. The setup is particularly brilliant, because Ernie Cline seems to have a laser-beam knowledge of (and warm, fuzzy love for) every pop song, arcade game, and giant robot produced in the last thirty years. Seriously, this is a guy who owns and regularly drives a 1982 DeLorean that has been mocked up to look exactly like the time-traveling car in <em>Back to the Future</em>, complete with a glowing flux capacitor.</p> <p>But <em>Ready Player One</em> isn&#x2019;t just a fanboy&#x2019;s wet dream. Real villains are lurking, threatening our hero with death in their ruthless hunt for the treasure. Worse, these corporate baddies are posers with no love for the game &#x2013; they have movie dialogue piped in via radio earpieces, use bots to cheat at arcade games like JOUST, and don&#x2019;t hesitate to terrorize or murder people in the real world to achieve their aims inside the OASIS.</p> <p>As the book climaxes, a mega-battle unfolds with sobering life-or-death stakes, yet soldiered entirely by exciting and downright fun pop-culture icons. The bad guys are piloting a ferocious Mechagodzilla. Our good guy has to leave his X-Wing fighter aboard his private flotilla so that he can pilot an authentic Ultraman recreation. And how do you not grin when someone dons a pair of virtual Chuck Taylor All Stars that bestow the power of flight?</p> <p>Cline is fearless and he lets his imagination soar, yet this pop scenery could easily come off as so much fluff. Instead, Cline keeps the stakes high throughout, and the epic treasure hunt structure (complete with an evolving high-score list) keeps the action intense. The plot unfolds with constant acceleration, never slowing down or sagging in the middle, to create a thrilling ride with a fulfilling ending.</p> <p>Best of all, the book captures the aura of the manifold worlds it depicts. If <em>Ready Player One</em> were a living room, it would be wood-panelled. If it were shoes, it would be high-tops. And if it were a song, well, it would have to be <em>Eye of the Tiger</em>.</p> <p>I really, really loved it.</p> <p><em>-- Daniel H. Wilson</em></p> <p><strong>Questions for Ernest Cline, Author of <em>Ready Player One</em></strong></p> <p><strong>Q)</strong> So it seems you&#x2019;re a bit of a pop-culture buff. In your debut novel <em>Ready Player One</em> you incorporate literally hundreds of pop culture references, many of them in ways that are integral to the book&#x2019;s plot. What&#x2019;s the first thing you remember geeking out over?</p> <p><strong>A)</strong> <em>Sesame Street</em> and the Muppets. I thought Jim Henson ruled the universe. I even thought it was pretty cool that I shared my first name with a muppet. Until the first day of kindergarten, when I quickly learned that "Ernie" was not a cool name to have. That was about the time I segued into my next childhood obsession, <em>Star Wars</em>.</p> <p><strong>Q)</strong> Like the book&#x2019;s hero, you possess a horrifyingly deep knowledge of a terrifyingly broad swathe of culture, ranging from John Hughes movies to super-obscure Japanese animation to 8-bit videogames to science-fiction and fantasy literature to role-playing games like Dungeons &amp; Dragons. What the heck is wrong with you?! How do you have so much time on your hands?</p> <p><strong>A)</strong> Well, I&#x2019;m raising a toddler now, so I don&#x2019;t have as much time to geek out as I used to. I think I amassed a lot of that knowledge during my youth. Like most geeks, I was a sponge for all kinds of movies, TV shows, cartoons, and video games. Then as an adult, I worked at a long series of low paying tech support jobs that allowed me to surf the Internet all day, and I spent a lot of my cubicle time looking up obscure pop culture minutiae from my childhood while I waited for people to reboot their PCs. Of course, I spent most of my off hours geeking out, too. Luckily, all those hours can now be classified as "research" for my novel.</p> <p><strong>Q)</strong> You&#x2019;re stranded on an island and you can only take one movie with you. What is it?</p> <p><strong>A)</strong> Easy! <em>The Lord of the Rings Extended Edition</em>. (Can I take all of the DVD Extras and Making of Documentaries, too?)</p> <p><strong>Q)</strong> You&#x2019;re given free tickets and back stage passes to one concert (artist can be living or dead)- who is it and why?</p> <p><strong>A)</strong> Are we talking about time travel back to a specific concert in the past here? Because it would be pretty cool to stand on the roof of Apple Records and watch the Beatles jam up there. But my favorite rock band that&#x2019;s still together is RUSH, and I just bought tickets to see them this June!</p> <p><strong>Q)</strong> Favorite book of all time.</p> <p><strong>A)</strong> That&#x2019;s an impossible question! I could maybe give you three favorites: <em>Snow Crash</em> by Neal Stephenson, <em>Galapagos</em> by Kurt Vonnegut, and <em>The Hitchhiker&#x2019;s Guide to the Galaxy</em> by Douglas Adams.</p> <p><strong>Q)</strong> Best failed TV show pilot available on Youtube?</p> <p><strong>A)</strong> The unaired Batgirl pilot starring Yvonne Craig.</p> <p><strong>Q)</strong> Favorite episode of Cowboy Bebop?</p> <p><strong>A)</strong> &#x201c;Ganymede Elegy.&#x201d; Or maybe &#x201c;Boogie Woogie Feng Shui.&#x201d;</p> <p><strong>Q)</strong> What&#x2019;s the first arcade game you ever played? What&#x2019;s your favorite?</p> <p><strong>A)</strong> I was deflowered by <em>Space Invaders</em>. My all time favorite coin-op game was probably <em>Black Tiger</em>.</p> <p><strong>Q)</strong> Your idea of the perfect day...</p> <p><strong>A)</strong> Play Black Tiger. Then go see <em>Big Trouble in Little China</em> at the Alamo Drafthouse with Kurt Russell and John Carpenter doing a live Q&amp;A afterwards. When I get home that night, I accidentally invent a cheap abundant clean energy source that saves human civilization. I celebrate by staying up late to watch old <em>Ultraman</em> episodes with my daughter (who loves <em>Ultraman</em> even more than I do).</p> <p><strong>Q)</strong> True or False. We hear you own a DeLorean and that you plan on tricking it out to be a time-travelling, Ghostbusting, Knight-Rider car.</p> <p><strong>A)</strong> False. I actually plan on tricking it out to be a time-traveling Ghostbusting Knight Riding Jet Car. It&#x2019;s going to have both a Flux Capacitor and an Oscillation Overthruster in it, so that my Delorean can travel through time AND solid matter. My personalized plates are ECTO88, just like a DeLorean that appears in my book.</p> <p>(I&#x2019;m so glad that you asked this question, because now I can justify buying the car as a "promotional tool" for my book. Everyone reading this is a witness! My DeLorean is helping me promote my book! The fact that I&#x2019;ve wanted one since I was ten years old is totally irrelevant!)</p> <p><strong>Q)</strong> Speaking of DeLoreans: biggest plot hole in the <em>Back to The Future</em> Films?</p> <p><strong>A)</strong> The <em>Back to The Future</em> Trilogy is perfect and contains no plot holes! Except for the plot hole inherent in nearly all time travel films: The planet Earth is moving through space at an immense speed at all times. So if you travel back in time, you are traveling to a time when the Earth was in a different location, and you and your time machine would appear somewhere out in deep space. For a time machine to be useful, it also needs to be able to teleport you to wherever the Earth was/is at your destination time.</p> <p><strong>Q)</strong> But there are two DeLoreans in 1885--why doesn&#x2019;t Doc dig out the one he buried in a cave for Marty to find in 1955 and use the gasoline from it to get the other DeLorean up to 88mph?</p> <p><strong>A)</strong> Doc would have drained the gas tank before he stored a car for 80 years, so there wouldn&#x2019;t have been any gas. And tampering with the DeLorean in the cave at all could conceivably create a universe-ending paradox, because it has to be in the cave for Marty to get back to 1885 in the first place. Totally not a plot hole!</p>ERNIE CLINE is best known for creating the cult film Fanboys, about a group of Star Wars fans on a pilgrimage to George Lucas&#39; Skywalker Ranch.

And East London--Olympic headquarters--is the city's new jewel, provider of unlimited opportunities and better tomorrows. The grime and poverty have been scrubbed away, and huge stadiums and grand public sculptures have taken their place.</p><p>The writer Iain Sinclair has lived in East London for four decades, and in <i>Ghost Milk</i>, he tells a very different story about his home: that of a neighborhood turned upside down, of stolen history. Long-beloved parks have vanished; police raids can occur at any time; and high-security exclusion zones--enforced by armed guards and hidden cameras--have steamrolled East London's open streets and public spaces. To prepare for the most public of events, everything has been privatized.</p><p>A call to arms against the politicians and public figures who have so doggedly preached the gospel of the Olympics, <i>Ghost Milk </i>is also a brilliant reflection on a changing landscape--and Sinclair's most personal book yet. In an attempt to understand what has happened to his beloved city, Sinclair travels farther afield: he walks along the Thames from the North Sea to Oxford; he rides the bus across northern England; he visits Athens and Berlin, Olympic sites of the recent and distant past.</p><p>Elegiac, intimate, and audacious, <i>Ghost Milk </i>is at once a powerful chronicle of memory and loss, in the tradition of W. G. Sebald and Roberto Bola�o, and a passionate interrogation of our embrace of progress at any cost.</p></p><p>Iain Sinclair is the author of many books, including <i>Downriver</i>, <i>Lights Out for the Territory</i>, <i>London Orbital</i>, and <i>Hackney, That Rose-Red Empire</i>.

If Stratford can be called East London. A bulging varicose vein on the flank of the A11, which fed somehow, through an enigma of unregistered places, low streets, tower blocks, into the A12. The highway out: Chelmsford, Colchester. A Roman road, so the accounts pinned up in town halls would have it, across brackish Thames tributary marshes. A slow accumulation against the persistence of fouled and disregarded rivers.<br>Stratford East. The other Stratford. Old town, new station. Imposing civic buildings arguing for their continued existence. A railway hub that, in its more frivolous moments, carried Sunday-supplement readers to Joan Littlewood&#x2019;s Theatre Royal, for provocations by Brendan Behan, Shelagh Delaney, Frank Norman. For pantomime Brecht. <i>Carry On</i> actors moonlighting in high culture. That was about as much as I knew, when the person at the desk in Manpower&#x2019;s Holborn offices told me I would be going to Chobham Farm.<br>&#x201c;Chobham Farm, Angel Lane, Stratford. Right now. This morning. If you fancy it.&#x201d;<br>This is how it worked: when I was down to my last ten pounds, I would take whatever Manpower had to offer. Employment on the day, for the day. Bring back the docket on Thursday and receive, deductions made, cash in hand. An office of Australians living out of their backpacks, woozy counterculturalists and squatters from condemned terraces in Mile End, Kilburn, Brixton. It was a dating agency, benevolent prostitution, introducing opt-out casuals to endangered industries desperate enough to hire unskilled, dope-smoking day labourers who would vanish before the first frost, the first wrong word from the foreman. There were always characters at the Holborn desk, justifying themselves, whining about the hours they spent trying to locate the factory in Ponders End where they would be invited to scrape congealed chocolate from the drum of a sugar-sticky vat with a bent teaspoon.<br>Everybody knew, on both sides of this deal, that it was 1971 and it was all over. The places we were dispatched to by the employment agency were, by definition, doomed. From my side, beyond the survivalist pittance earned, there was the excitement of being parachuted into squares of the map I had never visited; access was granted to dank riverside sheds, rock venues in Finsbury Park, cigar-packing operations in Clerkenwell.<br>&#x201c;The social contract is defunct,&#x201d; I muttered. I had been dabbling in Jean-Jacques Rousseau, not listening to politicians. Rubbish strikes and rat mountains enlivened our 8mm diary films. If the post didn&#x2019;t arrive, bills wouldn&#x2019;t have to be paid. We collaborated with civic entropy.<br>On Upper Thames Street, in a cellar under threat of inundation, I sorted and packed screws and bolts alongside a man in a tight, moss-green, three-piece suit. A Nigerian called Abraham Ojo. I remember that name because I inscribed it across the portrait I painted: <i>Abraham Ojo floats a company.</i> Steps dropping vertiginously to a sediment-heavy river. A schematic Blackfriars Bridge. Wharfs. Hoists. Black-windowed warehouses on the south bank. And astern Abraham with his arm raised to expose the heavy gold wristwatch. Those long wagging fingers with the thick wedding band. Like many West Africans in this floating world, and the ones met, eight years earlier, in my Brixton film school, Abraham Ojo never dressed down. Smart-casual meant leaving his waistcoat on the hanger he carried inside his black attach� case (with the pink <i>Financial Times</i> and the printed CV in glassine sleeve). He might, with mimed reluctance, shrug a nicotine-coloured storeman&#x2019;s coat over his interviewee&#x2019;s jacket, but he would never appear without narrow silk tie, or fiercely bulled shoes. He favoured horn-rim spectacles and a light dressing of Malcolm X goatee to emphasize a tapering chisel-blade chin. Like the Russians I&#x2019;ve been coming across, in recent times, running bars in old coaching inns in Thames Valley towns, ambitious Nigerians made it crystal clear: <i>I&#x2019;m not doing this.</i> Not now, not really. I am only here, on a temporary basis, because I have a scheme in which you might be permitted to invest: if you forget the fact that you saw me foul my hands with oily tools in a dripping vault.<br>It was a privilege of the period to encounter men like Abraham. I was fascinated to witness how he patronized his patrons, sneering at them as a caste without ambition or paper qualifications. He refused to register where he was, the specifics of place meant nothing. The chasms of the City, the close alleys and wind-tossed precincts, were knee-deep in banknotes, he assured me. Loose change waiting for a sympathetic address. My mediocre literary degree qualified me, barely, to be a low-level investor in Abraham&#x2019;s latest scam: the importation of cut-and-shut trucks into Nigeria. Documentation would be juggled. Sources of supply, in Essex and the Thames Estuary, were obscure. When we had enough in the fighting fund to tempt the right officials, cousins of cousins, we would be in clover.<br>As we talked, in our lunch break, down by the river, he kept his back to my wreck of a street-market bicycle. When I invited him to Hackney for a meal, he came with folders of papers, financial projections, lists of contacts. He enthralled the others at the table, potless painters, students without tenure, the manager of a tyre-replacement operation in Leytonstone, with a vision of hot-ripe places, deals with Russian diplomats and shaven-headed entrepreneurs from Bethnal Green who were looking to reinvest surplus loot from the black economy. He spoke of new cities on the edges of old jungles, a vibrant economy hungry for reliable or prestigious European motor vehicles. The voodoo of capital. The madness. Pooling our resources, the whole Hackney mob might have raised the funds to rent a beach hut in Margate. Seeing or not seeing the hopelessness of his pitch, Abraham continued. Mopping his brow with a linen napkin, pushing away the wine glass. Maybe it worked, maybe he&#x2019;s out there now, gold-plated Merc and bodyguards, in the oil fields of the Niger Delta. He never returned to the warehouse. His replacement, a man from Sydney, was a few inches shorter than me, but otherwise a Stevensonian double. The pure Aussie doppelg�nger. Another Sinclair. I never found out the full story of my great-grandfather&#x2019;s experiences in Tasmania, after his investments evaporated. He retired, came back from luxuriant Ceylon to bleak Banff on the North Sea, at the age of forty.<br>&#x201c;Now for the next ten years,&#x201d; he wrote, &#x201c;I extracted as much enjoyment out of life as perhaps ever falls to the lot of ordinary unambitious mortals; but at the end of this time I fell among thieves, and as misfortunes rarely come single, the <i>Hermileia</i> must needs play havoc with securities in Ceylon at the same time, so that I began to look abroad again for investments and occupation, resulting in a trip to <i>Tasmania</i>, an adventure often talked of with friends now gone.&#x201d;<br>Looking back, the astonishing aspect of life in my late twenties was that I had time to paint Abraham Ojo&#x2019;s portrait. The balance was still there, I suspect, between weeks lost to casual labour, that infiltration into the mystery of how a city works, involvement with a communal film diary, and the writing and publishing of invisible books. Fifty pounds of my wages saved from random employment in 1970 produced my first small collection of poems and prose fragments.

It is a book about the ways in which people outside the aviation business have looked at, dreamed about, and worried over powered flight in the century since the Wright brothers first showed a startled world that it was possible.<br><br><i>Imagining Flight</i> focuses on the United States, but also contrasts American ideas and attitudes with those of other air-minded nations, including Britain, France, Germany, and Japan. Among the topics covered are: dreams of aviation's future, from the Wright brothers to the space shuttle; pilots as heroes, including Lindbergh, Earhart, Yeager, and the "Red Baron"; the promise (and threat) of aerial bombing; five decades of airline advertising and the changing expectations it created; aviation disasters, and the stories we tell about them; and flight in film and television, stories and songs.<br><br><i>Imagining Flight</i> carries these themes into the twenty-first century and considers them in light of the September 11 terrorist attacks and the <i>Columbia</i><i> </i>disaster. It is thus the first book to explore the <i>entire</i> first century of flight through the eyes of those who watched it from the ground.</p><p>A.

Includes facts about the real Ima, daughter of Texas Governor James Stephen Hogg.</p><p>Kindergarten-Grade 3-While the great ostrich race is fiction, the "mettle" of Miss Ima is not. Daughter of the late-19th-century Texas governor James Hogg, Ima grew up to be Houston's-and Texas's-most beloved philanthropist. McManis takes a historical tidbit of ostriches in the governor's mansion in Austin and shows readers a 10-year-old Ima who is determined to best her taunting brothers by racing her Ossy against their fine quarter horses. Among the charming vernacular is this inspiration: "Dirt clogged my throat and eyes, but mettle filled my heart." Dupree's cartoon watercolors nicely complement McManis's description of Ima's pluck, and the quilt blocks (yellow rose, bluebonnet, lone star, etc.) in the corners of most paintings are an inspired touch. This tall tale not only fits Miss Ima's character but should also motivate youngsters to learn more about this fine, humble Texas woman.<br><i>John Sigwald, Unger Memorial Library, Plainview, TX</i><br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Train of States</h2><p><p>The train of states is rolling by --<br> rush to the window and watch it go!<br> The very first car?

Czech-born illustrator Sis celebrates his adopted country with an election-year salute to its 50 states. Inspired by his visit to Wisconsin's Circus World Museum, he presents each state as an elaborately decorated, antique circus wagon, emblazoned with symbolic, often whimsical images that range from state birds to native trees (and sons). Together, the wagons comprise a train of states being pulled, on kaleidoscopic wheels, past a schoolroom of dazzled children. The cars are ordered by the date of the state's admission to the union, leading off with Delaware, "The First State," and concluding with a Washington, D.C., "caboose." In the cab of a red-white-and-blue locomotive are the iconographic figures of Uncle Sam and an American eagle. A banner at the bottom of each page notes the state capital, tree, flower, and bird, along with a "fun fact" (elk, deer, and antelope outnumber humans in Montana). But it's the wagons--with their rococo embellishments and glorious gallimaufry of visual factoids, trivia, hoopla, and American hyperbole--that command attention and invite endless, wondering reexamination. Each look reveals something new, and, as if that were not enough, an appended page of notes offers further information that encourages children to create their own "train of states." Another dazzler from the incomparable Sis. <i>Michael Cart</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

He grows up frolicking in the meadow, befriending butterflies and screech owls, and learning about the dark fear of all the woodland creatures: man. Over time, Bambi seeks out the wisdom of the prince of deer, a magnificent old stag who walks alone through the paths of the forest. Bambi is torn between his desire to be with his beloved mate, Faline, and his yearning for the knowledge and solitude the prince represents. He is also conflicted about his friend Gobo, who has returned to the forest after a winter living among humans. Gobo behaves unnaturally by strolling through the woods by day when other deer are sleeping, showing no fear of his natural mortal enemy.<p> This 1926 classic has been stretched and squeezed into many forms over the years, but the Felix Salten original should not be missed. With the richer, more highly wrought language of his time, Salten crafts a story layered in meaning, weighty with its message.

Instead, Peppi shocks them all with his decision to leave Rhode Island and return to Villa San Giuseppe, the small Italian village where he spent his childhood, and to <i>il</i> <i>mulino</i>, his family's old mill. But once he's back, he temporarily moves into an apartment over the candy factory run by his childhood best friend, Luca. It is modest, but livable, with a lovely view of Luca's neglected gardens and his equally neglected daughter, the fiery Lucrezia.<br><br>More a force of nature than a woman, Lucrezia's legendary temper and workaholic schedule hide the very real pain she feels over her husband's death years before. At first, she tolerates Peppi as an eccentric annoyance--her father's strange but handsome American friend who fixes things around the factory and is bringing the gardens back to life. But soon, Lucrezia's interest in Peppi deepens. Like a high wind, the gossip is flying through Villa San Giuseppe--Lucrezia's making it to dinner on time. She's eating olives from a man's hand.<br><br>She's wearing heels. Now, under the Italian sun, a tentative romance begins to bloom between the grieving pair, yielding to a surprisingly strong passion with the power to heal life's wounds and promise second chances. . .</p><p>Peter Pezzelli lives with his wife, two children, and their dog in Rhode Island where, most days, he is busy at work on his next novel.&#34;A beautiful novel...Peter Pezzelli captures the warmth of Italy--family, friendships, and food--invites us into the world of his wonderful characters, and takes us full circle on a journey of life and love.&#34;</p><h2>Lincoln and the Court</h2><p><p>In a meticulously researched and engagingly written narrative, Brian McGinty rescues the story of Abraham Lincoln and the Supreme Court from long and undeserved neglect, recounting the compelling history of the Civil War president's relations with the nation's highest tribunal and the role it played in resolving the agonizing issues raised by the conflict.</p><p>Lincoln was, more than any other president in the nation's history, a "lawyerly" president, the veteran of thousands of courtroom battles, where victories were won, not by raw strength or superior numbers, but by appeals to reason, citations of precedent, and invocations of justice. He brought his nearly twenty-five years of experience as a practicing lawyer to bear on his presidential duties to nominate Supreme Court justices, preside over a major reorganization of the federal court system, and respond to Supreme Court decisions--some of which gravely threatened the Union cause.</p><p>The Civil War was, on one level, a struggle between competing visions of constitutional law, represented on the one side by Lincoln's insistence that the United States was a permanent Union of one people united by a "supreme law," and on the other by Jefferson Davis's argument that the United States was a compact of sovereign states whose legal ties could be dissolved at any time and for any reason, subject only to the judgment of the dissolving states that the cause for dissolution was sufficient. Alternately opposed and supported by the justices of the Supreme Court, Lincoln steered the war-torn nation on a sometimes uncertain, but ultimately triumphant, path to victory, saving the Union, freeing the slaves, and preserving the Constitution for future generations.</p></p><p>Brian McGinty is an attorney and writer specializing in American history and law.&#x201c;The most complete account to date of President Lincoln and the Supreme Court in wartime. In a beautifully written narrative, McGinty makes complicated legal issues accessible, and his descriptions of the Dickensian characters involved in this contentious and critical period are fascinating. He makes clear that of all U.S. presidents, Lincoln was the lawyer in the White House.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Frank J. Williams, Chief Justice of the Rhode Island Supreme Court, and founding chair of The Lincoln Forum</b><br><br>&#x201c;McGinty's outstanding work on Lincoln's relationship with the Supreme Court has long been needed, and is especially trenchant as we deal anew with the limits of governmental power versus individual rights. McGinty brings a valuable background in law to this thoughtful and perceptive account of what Lincoln and the war did to and with the relationship between law and freedom.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>William C. Davis, author of <i>Jefferson Davis: The Man and His Hour</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;McGinty offers a lucid review of the major Civil War Supreme Court cases. The Civil War, as McGinty explains, was a struggle over constitutional interpretation: did Lincoln have the constitutional authority to do whatever he thought necessary to compel seceding states back to the Union? He thought so, but Chief Justice Roger Brooke Taney sometimes stood in his way. The first major clash was over Lincoln's suspension of habeas corpus, which Taney declared unconstitutional in the 1861 Merryman case. In 1862 came another battle, the Prize cases, regarding the constitutionality of Lincoln's declaring a blockade of Confederate ports. The Court also heard cases about whether a Union citizen could criticize a president during wartime and whether the Treasury Department could regulate trade between a Union state and the Confederacy. McGinty says that the Court "could have struck down the president's major war measures" but "chose not to do so"... McGinty's engaging account, which treats a topic with obvious parallels to the present, will delight history buffs.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;It's not easy to find Lincoln territory where good, open grazing land remains, but McGinty has found it. Combining expertise as an attorney and historian with a style that welcomes readers, he gives us Lincoln the lawyer-president who worked with a Supreme Court to which he ultimately appointed five members. The Civil War brought forth numerous legal conflicts, and McGinty shows that the personalities and issues involved were as vital and fascinating as those we are more familiar with on the military side.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Margaret Heilbrun</b><b>, </b><b><i>Library Journal</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[A] fascinating book...The issue of presidential power in wartime is as fresh as today's headlines.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Charles Lane</b><b>, </b><b><i>Washington Post</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Lincoln and the Court</i> addresses a subject that has been neglected, if not ignored, by historians: the story of our sixteenth president and the Supreme Court during the Civil War...Brian McGinty has written an important book for military historians...This is a well-written, tightly organized, and thoughtful book that will appeal to anyone interested in a new perspective on Lincoln's actions as Commander-in-Chief, and the legality of measures he took to achieve a Union victory.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Fred L.

But victory over the Nazi regime was not celebrated in western Europe until May 8, and in Russia a day later, on the ninth. Why did a peace agreement take so much time? How did this brutal, protracted conflict coalesce into its unlikely endgame?<p>&nbsp;<br> <i>After Hitler </i>shines a light on ten fascinating days after that infamous suicide that changed the course of the twentieth century. Combining exhaustive research with masterfully paced storytelling, Michael Jones recounts the F�hrer&#x2019;s frantic last stand; the devious maneuverings of his handpicked successor, Karl D�nitz; the grudging respect Joseph Stalin had for Churchill and FDR, as well as his distrust of Harry Truman; the bold negotiating by General Dwight D. Eisenhower that hastened Germany&#x2019;s surrender but drew the ire of the Kremlin; the journalist who almost scuttled the cease-fire; and the thousands of ordinary British, American, and Russian soldiers caught in the swells of history, from the Red Army&#x2019;s march on Berlin to the liberation of the Nazis&#x2019; remaining concentration camps. Through it all, Jones traces the shifting loyalties between East and West that sowed the seeds of the Cold War and nearly unraveled the Grand Alliance. <br> &nbsp;<br> In this gripping, eloquent, and even-handed narrative, the spring of 1945 comes alive&#x2014;a fascinating time when nothing was certain, and every second mattered....</p><p>INCLUDES PHOTOS</p></p><p><p><b>Michael Jones</b> is a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society and a member of the British Commission for Military History.

For many, in the Allied armed forces and among the civilians who supported the war effort, it is a last opportunity to connect with a vitally important achievement&#x2014;the overthrow of Hitler and the Nazi regime. We remember those who sacrificed their lives so that we might see this day. All of us are in their debt.</p><p>This book tells the story of the last ten days of the war, from the death of Hitler on April 30 to the celebration of VE-Day in Moscow on May 9, a day after it is held in the West.</p><p>In its structure, it follows a countdown formula from day to day&#x2014;but within this framework it also takes a thematic approach, bringing out the complex international politics and diplomacy that underlay these military events. It also addresses a wider concern&#x2014;the humanitarian catastrophe that was engulfing Europe and the psychological impact this had on those caught up in it.</p><p>Its central aim is to show why we celebrate two VE-Days&#x2014;May 8 in the West, May 9 in the East (although the Channel Islands also celebrate their liberation on May 9): how this came about and what its real significance is. These separate days tell a story of the common cause between allies, but also of the divisions that nearly caused a rift between them in the days after Hitler&#x2019;s death. It was a crisis largely hidden from public view and in the event it was successfully mastered. All those involved in the behind-the-scenes diplomacy deserve credit for that.</p><p>I have tried to present a view that is fair to all the members of the Grand Alliance, and in particular the Soviet Union&#x2014;whose motives in May 1945 (and indeed throughout the war) were sometimes viewed with considerable suspicion in the West&#x2014;recognizing its major contribution to the victory against Nazi Germany and that it had legitimate concerns of its own. In a final reckoning, we will never know whether the descent into the Cold War was inevitable. I look at the pernicious influence of the administration of �Hitler&#x2019;s successor, Admiral D�nitz, whose shadowy role in the days after the F�hrer&#x2019;s death is often underestimated&#x2014;and the fears of both sides as the post-war map of Europe began to unfold. In such circumstances, I believe it was a real achievement that the Alliance held firm at the war&#x2019;s very end.</p><p>I also try to acknowledge those issues that were not resolved as this terrible war drew to its close. I counterpoint the victory celebrations in the West with the course of the little-known but important uprising in Prague in the East. On May 8, 1945, while London was <i>en f�te </i>with all the joys of VE-Day, the Czech capital was fighting for its very life. By a quite miraculous series of events Prague was saved&#x2014;but the Russian Liberation Army, which played a crucial part in rescuing the city, would be less lucky. Amid the euphoria, the war&#x2019;s end involved awkward and sometimes unjust political compromises. But in the final defeat of the Third Reich and all that it stood for there was also real reason for hope.</p><p>In the summer of 2008 I visited Berlin with the instructions of two veterans fresh in my mind. One, Armin Lehmann, had been a member of the Hitler Youth and a courier to the F�hrer in the last terrible days of fighting in the city, as the war drew to its close. He had been in the F�hrer Bunker on the morning of Hitler&#x2019;s death, on April 30, 1945. A day later, Armin had made a hellish breakout through the burning rubble of Berlin&#x2014;eventually reaching the safety of American lines on the River Elbe. The other, Red Army lieutenant Vasily Ustyugov, had on the same day&#x2014;April 30&#x2014;been only a few hundred meters away from Armin, fighting inside the Reichstag&#x2014;which, despite lying in ruins for most of Hitler&#x2019;s rule, became a symbol for the Russians of the hated Nazi regime. For Armin, the beginning of May 1945 was the collapse of everything he believed in; for Vasily, it was a triumphant vindication of a patriotic cause. As I visited some of the places seared in their memories and powerfully recounted in their stories, the genesis of this book emerged&#x2014;the story of the last days of the Second World War, the days after Hitler&#x2019;s death.</p><p>The concept grew the following autumn when I embarked on a cruise of the Black Sea under the banner of the BBC History Magazine Team<i>, </i>alongside fellow lecturers Greg Neale and Martin Folly. It was a powerful experience to visit Yalta and the site of the great summit in February 1945 that decisively shaped post-war Europe, and to hear Dr. Folly&#x2019;s ideas on the three-power diplomacy between Britain, America and the Soviet Union that was its anvil. Since then, many have helped in this book&#x2019;s evolution. Alongside Martin, I would like to thank Professor Geoffrey Roberts of the University of Cork, Dr. Elke Scherstjanoi of Berlin&#x2019;s Institut f�r Zeitgeschichte, and particularly Richard Hargreaves&#x2014;who shared his knowledge of the siege of Breslau and German archives in general&#x2014;and Tomas Jakl of Prague&#x2019;s Military Institute, who guided my work on the uprising of May 1945.</p><p>Many veterans have given generously of their time. I would especially like to thank Antonin Sticha of the Czech House of Veterans in Prague for sharing his own memories of the uprising there and facilitating other interviews. Alexander Ivanov of the Russian Council of War Veterans in Moscow also arranged a number of important meetings. And Julie Chervinsky of the Blavatnik Foundation Archive has drawn my attention to a number of moving veteran accounts.

Foreign documentary material has also been drawn from the Prague City Archives, the Bundesarchiv at Freiburg, the Russian Ministry of Defense Archive at Podolsk and the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), Washington. Ralph Gibson of RIA Novosti kindly helped me with some of the illustrative material and also located some eyewitness accounts of Moscow on May 9, 1945.</p><p>I am grateful to Amanda Helm for giving me access to the unpublished&nbsp;memoir of her father, Captain Derek Thomas, and to Russell Porter for sharing the reminiscences of his father, Lance-Corporal Ray Porter, both of the British 6th Airborne Division, and to the Airborne Forces website for additional veteran information. I would like to thank the BBC for permission to cite from their &#x201c;People&#x2019;s War&#x201d; online archive (those involved are individually acknowledged in the endnotes). I have also benefited enormously from the material on the numerous US divisional websites.

As a European child of the 1950s, his relationship to painting is inevitably structured by television, cinema and by the lingering effects of World War II; more recent historical preoccupations have included the dramatic turn of world events post-9/11. Tuymans combines a muted palette with deteriorated surface effect and a singular use of cropping, close-up and sequencing--perfect devices with which to undertake his investigation of the pathological, the banal and the conspiratorial. Published in conjunction with the artist's first full-scale American survey, this is without question the authoritative publication on Tuymans. It features approximately 75 key works from 1978 to the present, and is accompanied by essays analyzing the painter's main concerns, with particular attention paid to his working process and his adaptation of source materials. Helen Molesworth examines themes of sinister banality, Joseph Leo Koerner writes on iconophobia and iconophilia, Ralph Rugoff considers the nature of visual experience in light of Tuymans' recent work, and Bill Horrigan examines cinematic sources. This book is not only the most comprehensive survey of Tuymans' career to date, but also the most thorough chronology of his artistic development.<br> Born in Mortsel, Belgium, in 1958, <b>Luc Tuymans</b> first exhibited his paintings in 1985, at Palais des Thermes in Ostend. His first U.S. exhibition came ten years later, at The Renaissance Society in Chicago. He has also worked in film and printmaking.</p><p>&#34;the most challenging painter in the recent history of art... if you like painting enough you will gamely tolerate the bitter flavor of this artist&#39;s amazingly intoxicating brew.&#34; --The New Yorker, Peter Schjeldahl</p><h2>World of Warcraft: Mists of Pandaria Signature Series Guide (Bradygames Signature Series Guide)</h2><p><p> <strong>Explore A New Continent</strong> -Explore the Lost Continent of Pandaria with detailed maps of each zone, and what resources you'll find in them as you guide your characters to level 90. </p> <p> <strong>Pandaren: A New Ally or a New Enemy?</strong> - Pandaren, the all-new race for Mists of Pandaria, can choose to join either the Horde or Alliance in their on-going struggle for supremacy of Azeroth.

His underwater photography has been called uncanny, lithe and athletic, exquisitely real, and mysterious, and has been widely imitated in art and advertising. The dancers seem to transcend time and space to become floating, ethereal objects. Schatz&#39;s new underwater photographs are shot in a state-of-the-art, custom-built pool fitted with studio lights and covered with a giant dome to regulate temperature. The results are stunning. His unique images---at once lyrical, fantastic, and palpably real---express the beauty of inspired movement magically free of the restrictions of gravity.</p><p>Howard Schatz lives in New York with his wife and business partner, Beverly Ornstein. His work has been exhibited in museums and photography galleries internationally and has been published in numerous magazines as well as in fifteen books of photography including the critically acclaimed ATHLETE, BOTANICA, and IN CHARACTER: ACTORS ACTING.

Salak retraced the steps of British explorer Ivan Champion who, in 1927, traversed New Guinea and Papua via the Fly River, hiking the highlands and ascending the Sepik River. Solo travelers in this country are rare because of the difficulty of navigating swamps, jungle terrain and mountain trails as well as dealing with torrential rains and relentless mosquitoes. In addition, there is a high crime rate; poor young men leave their tribal homelands, flock to the city of Port Moresby in search of wealth, and wind up stealing from whomever they can. No stranger to harrowing journeys, Salak has sought out exotic locales since her teens and recounts here how she was nearly raped in Mozambique. As well as detailing her trip, she ruminates on her unquenchable appetite for danger and recalls a childhood spent in a truly dysfunctional family. Amid the breathtaking landscapes and wildlife of Papua New Guinea, Salak daily tested her physical endurance. She encountered a variety of both friendly and indifferent tribal peoples and talked with Pastor Carl, the leader of a guerrilla band fighting the Indonesian takeover of Western New Guinea. Salak has not only achieved her goal of crossing Papua New Guinea, but also her lifelong dream of authorship with this consistently interesting and well-written memoir. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>The Immortals (Olympus Bound, 1)</h2><p><b>In this modern-day "lively re-imagining of classical mythology" (Deborah Harkness), when a string of women are murdered in an ancient pagan ritual, Selene DiSilvia -- known by some as the goddess Artemis -- hears their cries for help and takes up her bow once more.</b><b><br></b><i>Manhattan has many secrets.

C. Grayling, is the series of liberation struggles without which the ordinary citizen in Western countries would not enjoy the rights and freedoms we now take for granted. They began with the often violent battle to allow independent thought, uncontrolled by the Church, which led in time to political freedom as monarchies were gradually replaced by more representative forms of government. These in turn made possible the abolition of slavery, rights for working men and women, universal education, the enfranchisement of women, and much more.</p><p>Each of these struggles was a memorable human drama, and Grayling skillfully interweaves the stories of celebrated and little-known heroes alike&#x2015;from Martin Luther and John Locke to the sixteenth-century French scholar Sebastien Castellio and the nineteenth-century feminist Elizabeth Cady Stanton. The triumphs and sacrifices of those who dared to oppose authority ring loudly down the ages, proving how hard-won each successive victory has been. And yet, as Grayling persuasively shows in a cautionary coda, democratic governments under pressure have often thought it necessary to restrict rights in the name of freedom, further underlining how precious they are. <i>Toward the Light of Liberty</i> is, thus, particularly relevant as we head toward an election season in which our own civil liberties will surely be an issue.</p></p><p><p><b>A. C. Grayling </b>is a professor of philosophy at Birkbeck College, University of London. He is the author of the acclaimed <i>Among the Dead Cities</i>, and of <i>Descartes: The Life and Times of a Genius</i>. A frequent contributor to newspapers and magazines, he lives in London.</p>Do we take our liberties for granted at the risk of losing them in the war on terror? Grayling (<i>Descartes: The Life and Times of a Genius</i>), a professor of philosophy at Birkbeck College, University of London, and a leading British public intellectual, believes so. This book is, in some respects, an old-fashioned, triumphalist history of the rise of Western liberty since the 16th century (with Martin Luther, John Locke and Elizabeth Cady Stanton playing leading role), but nevertheless serves as a stirring call to arms to defend freedom from its enemies within and without. Grayling argues that the struggle for liberty has been one of sacrifice and hardship on the part of many heroic individuals. Despite the blood and the violence, it has been worth it: Today's ordinary Western citizen is, in sixteenth-century terms, a lord: a possessor of rights, entitlements, opportunities and resources that only an aristocrat of that earlier period could hope for. But, Grayling somberly writes, the process of losing our inheritance of liberty might have already begun. Grayling provides a refreshing tonic to any inclination toward apathy or cynicism, and his book will only gain in relevance as the 2008 presidential election looms.

A major aim is to help the reader acquire a critical eye for classifying model types and list many of the major model collections. It is not, however, a how-to-do-it model guide. While the book will explain and illustrate the undoubted aesthetic qualities of models for those interested in maritime history, it will be a particularly useful reference work for collectors, dealers and museum staff with a commercial interest in ship models.</p><p></p><h2>National Geographic Guide to America&#39;s Outdoors: Pacific Northwest: Nature Adventures in Parks, Preserves, Forests, Wildlife Refuges, Wilderness Areas</h2><p><p> <b>Oregon Washington</b> </p><p> With southern British Columbia, western Idaho, and northern California </p><p> <b>In this practical, informative, richly illustrated guide, National Geographic takes you to the best nature sites in the Pacific Northwest and tells you what you need to know -- about the landscape, plants, animals, activities, and recreation -- to experience them fully. </b></p><p><b> * Over 55 major sites, plus numerous smaller ones, grouped by bioregion, including national parks, forests, and wildlife refuges; state parks; conservation areas and preserves; and wild and scenic rivers.<br> * Guided hikes and drives.<br> * Suggestions of where to hike, bike, camp, kayak, fish, see wildlife, and more.<br> * Detailed resource listings.<br> * 150 vivid, color photos and 25 detailed, full-color maps.</b></p></p><p></p><h2>Rocks from Space: Meteorites and Meteorite Hunters</h2><p>A non-technical introduction to the world of meteorites, asteroids, comets and impact craters. Astronomer Norton begins with an overview of international falls, finds, and craters; describes hunting and recovering; the origins and identifying characteristics of each type of meteorite; and what the cosmos might hurl our way in the future. Includes a profile of two of this century&#39;s most eminent meteorite hunters. Annotation copyright Book News, Inc. Portland, Or.</p><p>O. Richard Norton is former director of the Grace Flandrau Planetarium and Science Center at the University of Arizona and the Fleischmann Planetarium at the University of Nevada at Reno. He studied meteoritics under world-renowned meteoriticist Frederick C. Leonard. Norton currently teaches astronomy at Central Oregon Community College and serves as president of Science Graphics, a company that produces instructional science slides for use in college and university classrooms.Astronomy abounds with amateurs, and the easiest entr&#x201a;e to the hobby is meteor watching. Anyone can see a few shooting stars on any night. For nighthawks and insomniacs, then, Norton offers this quaint miscellany crammed with facts and stories about extraterrestrial rocks, along with 200 photos. "Falls," as Norton calls the pieces that reach the ground, exert great scientific interest, so he describes past expeditions to collect them and examine the ancient craters they gouged out. Meteoriticist H. H. Nininger was one such explorer, and his life, which culminated in running a commercial meteor museum, illustrates the obsessive enthusiasm the hobby can induce. Although a field book might be more authoritative, Norton's tome will help slake the curiosity and worries that surround cosmic collisions, especially so soon after a comet hit Jupiter last month. <i>Gilbert Taylor</i></p><h2>Charley Harper ABCs: Skinny Edition</h2><p>A classic ABC board book featuring the colorful wildlife illustrations of Charley Harper.

Lewis called him the wittiest man in Europe, and Ronald Knox was a deft apologist, an astute translator of the Bible, and the preacher for occasions great and small throughout the first half of the twentieth century in England. But he was first and last a priest, and it is in his sermons and retreat conferences that we meet Ronald Knox the spiritual guide. <i>A Retreat for Lay People</i> brings together a collection of his conferences preached over a period of fifteen years. His opening topic is Discouragement in Retreat, and he concludes with a reflection on Our Lady's Serenity. In between, Knox addresses the big questions - the fear of death, the problem of suffering, the world to come - but he also explores the little questions that loom large in our daily lives, like minor trials, liberty of spirit in prayer, and the use of God's creatures. Msgr. Knox shapes his collection around the classic <i>Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius</i>. The first eight conferences address the foundations of our spiritual life; the next eight offer reflections on the life of Our Lord; the final eight take up practical questions of living our faith in daily life. These pieces of eight are punctuated by two meditations suitable for a Holy Hour. The Eucharist was at the heart of Knox's life and his profound love for Christ in the Blessed Sacrament shines through in these talks. As in all his writing, in these conferences Ronald Knox combines love for Scripture, commitment to the Catholic faith, and sympathy for the struggles and joys of Christian discipleship. <i>A Retreat for Lay People</i> is solid spiritual food, served up with refreshing simplicity and a dash of wit.</p><p>Throughout the first half of the 20th century, both as an Anglican and as a Roman Catholic, Ronald Knox was a well-known part of the English literary landscape. He was a favored preacher for occasions great and small; his articles on a host of topics found a place in the newspapers and monthly literary magazines; his voice was heard often on the BBC. He wrote numerous popular spiritual and literary works including The Belief of Catholics, Captive Flames, The Hidden Stream and Pastoral and Occasional Sermons.</p><h2>Halloween Surprise (My First)</h2><p>This simple lift-the-flap book is packed with Halloween surprises for your child!

It's just another dead Indian."</i> <br> -- Justine English, sister of murder victim Mary Jane Serloin </p><p> John Martin Crawford is a serial sex killer, but his crimes have gone almost unnoticed in the media and he is currently serving out his three concurrent life sentences in virtual anonymity. In addition to a prior sentence for manslaughter, Crawford has been convicted of three murders, all of them women, all of them Native. He is also suspected in at least three other murders or mysterious disappearances of aboriginal women. His name should be as notorious as those of Paul Bernardo and Charles Ng. Yet few people have heard of him. </p><p> Author Warren Goulding raises disturbing questions about racism in both the police force and the media treatment of John Crawford and his victims. He lays bare the assumptions and attitudes that resulted not only in Crawford's obscurity, but the public dismissal of the deaths of Mary Jane Serloin, Shelley Napope, Eva Taysup, and Calinda Waterhen. The result is a gripping and disquieting book that questions the value a predominantly white society places on aboriginal lives. </p><p> Saskatchewan Book Award winner Non-Fiction category, 2001 </p></p><p><p> Warren Goulding's work has appeared in Canadian publications including: <i>Macleans</i>, the <i>Globe and Mail</i>, and various newspapers across the country. He has also written for the <i>Hong Kong Sunday Morning Post</i> and several business magazines in Canada. Currently, Goulding is the publisher of the <i>Chemainus Courier</i>, a monthly community newspaper, and the Associate Editor of the <i>Eagle Feather News</i>, a Saskatchewan publication dealing with topics of interest to First Nation and Metis communities. </p>"It seems any time a Native is murdered, it isn't a major case. It's just another dead Indian."<br><br>"In the flawlessly structured and clearly argued Just Another Indian, author Warren Goulding, who covered the Crawford trial for Maclean's magazine describes the discovery of the remains, the police investigation, and Crawford's eventual capture, trial, and imprisonment. But this book is more than a true-crime tome: Goulding visited the families of the victims, and he used their memories (and a series of letters written by the 16-year-old Napope) to paint intimate portraits of the women. These Life stories are central to the book's purpose, which is to illustrate media indifference to these women (when their deaths were so briefly mentioned, even though some weren't)."</p><h2>Louis Armstrong: An American Genius</h2><p>A biography of the great jazz trumpeter traces his growth as an artist, his success as an entertainer, and his relationships with fellow musicians</p><p>James Lincoln Collier is the author of many books and articles on jazz, notably The Making of Jazz and Louis Armstrong: An American Genius.

It was at Cherkassy that the last German offensive strength in the Ukraine was drained away, creating the conditions for the victorious Soviet advance into Poland, Rumania, and the Balkans during the summer and autumn of 1944. Eclipsed by a war of such gigantic proportions that saw the deaths of over one million men or more as commonplace, the events which occurred along the banks of the Gniloy Tickich river should have faded into obscurity. However, to the 60,000 German soldiers who were encircled there at the end of January 1944, this was perhaps one of the most brutal, physically exhausting, and morally demanding battles they had ever experienced. Thirty-four percent of them would not escape. The culmination of years of research and survivor interviews, Hell&#39;s Gate is a riveting hour by hour and day by day account of this desperate struggle analyzed on a tactical level through maps and military transcripts, as well as on a personal level, through the words of the enlisted men and officers who risked the roaring waters of the Gniloy Tickich to avoid certain death at the hands of their Soviet foe.</p><p></p><h2>Early American Dolls in Full Color, The Creative Genius of Unsophisticated America</h2><p>Early American Dolls in Full Color, The Creative Genius of Unsophisticated America</p><p></p><h2>Hearts and Hands: Creating Community in Violent Times</h2><p>Hearts and Hands deals with many of the difficult issues addressed in Luis Rodr�guez&#x2019;s memoir of gang life, Always Running, but with a focus on healing through community building. Empowered by his experiences as a peacemaker with gangs in Los Angeles and Chicago, Rodr�guez offers a unique book of change. He makes concrete suggestions, shows how we can create nonviolent opportunities for youth today, and redirects kids into productive and satisfying lives. And he warns that we sacrifice community values for material gain when we incarcerate or marginalize people already on the edge of society. His interest in dissolving gang influence on black and latino kids is personal as well as societal; his son, to whom he dedicates Hearts and Hands, is currently serving a prison sentence for gang-related activity. With anecdotes, interviews, and time-tested guidelines, Hearts and Hands makes a powerful argument for building and supporting community life.</p><p><p>Best known for his autobiographical <i>Always Running: La Vida Loca: Gang Days in L.A.</i>, <b>LUIS RODRIGUEZ</b> has written for the<i> Nation</i>, <i>Grand Street</i>, and the <i>Los Angeles Weekly</i>, among others. Winner of a National Book Award, a Lannan Foundation Fellowship, and an Illinois Arts Council Fellowship for poetry, Rodriguez is also the founder of T�a Chucha Press, which publishes emerging socially conscious poets. He lives in San Fernando, California, with his wife, Trina, and their family. In 2014, Rodriguez was named Poet Laureate of the City of Los Angeles.</p>Rodriguez (Always Running: La Vida Loca: Gang Days in L.A.) here takes a long, hard look at the endemic violence and the "cultural malaise of isolation and meaninglessness" that he sees as defining swaths of U.S. culture. Combining personal memoir, perceptive sociological analysis and astute advice about political organizing, Rodriguez, whose youth included "drugs, jail, and gang warfare," writes movingly of how he turned his life around and dedicated himself to working with teens at risk. While attacking the image of teenage males as the primary instigators of violent behavior, Rodriguez focuses on the specific problems of young males "trying to negotiate their lives" in the face of enormous problems, with little in the way of adult models. (The group dynamics of gangs give members "the empowerment that other institutions including schools and families fail to provide.) Rodriguez urges the conscious creation of a "holy space" as a "temporary sustainable community" from which to fight violence. Always conscious of the role of poverty and behavior learned in prisons, Rodriguez warns of the persistent problem of adults overreacting to child violence, as when a five-year-old girl was arrested and fingerprinted "for allegedly `assaulting' a fifty-one-year-old school counselor." Never sentimentalizing or sensationalizing his materials, Rodriguez writes honestly and incisively from experience, knowledge and compassion. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Culp&#39;s Hill at Gettysburg: The Mountain Trembled...</h2><p>The heavily wooded slopes of Culp&#39;s Hill do not easily lend themselves to visions of long, gallant lines of charging infantry as do other areas on the battlefield at Gettysburg. But the regimental monuments and traces of breastworks that line the slopes of Culp&#39;s Hill bear silent testament to the hellish conflict: no other spot at Gettysburg would see such a sustained period of brutal combat as when North and South vied for this ground. The reader is invited to tour this seldom explored segment of the battle using maps, photos, and first-hand accounts to help understand the unique character of the struggle for Culp&#39;s Hill and the men who fought for its slopes.</p><p>Although Yankee born and bred, John Archer&#39;s fascination with the Civil War stems from a childhood discovery of Confederate ancestors in his family tree. He now lives in Gettysburg, where in addition to writing, he works as a Licensed Guide for the Gettysburg National Military Park, and at Gettysburg College. His interpretive tours have been featured in PCN TV&#39;s Gettysburg Battlewalks Series.

With the aid of a wily lawyer, she has managed to get off with a misdemeanor charge plus a few hours of community service, and the city is outraged. So when Whitney is shot to death while picking up roadside trash (as part of her community service), people seem happy to accept the cops' verdict that she's just another casualty of a neighborhood where the chief hobby is indiscriminate shooting. Callahan had been doing some detective work on Whitney's spectacularly messy divorce before the shooting and now she's been hired by Whitney's daughter to track down the killer. Callahan uncovers suspects from every social stratum: the parents of the girl Whitney killed, Whitney's greedy ex-husband, and his fluffily malevolent new gal pal. Only a crazy man witnessed Whitney's murder and he communicates solely via biblical riddles and allegorical paintings.<br>As she races to uncover the killer before she herself gets killed, Callahan's riotous personal life rattles along at full throttle. Her hated sister and brother-in-law move in while their house is being renovated (for renting out during the Olympics), her irascible mom, Edna, suffers some (literal) heart trouble of her own, and the rogues' gallery of "girls" in her employ offer a wealth of comic relief - from unusual table settings to impotent emus.</p><p><p><strong>Kathy Hogan Trocheck</strong> is the author of ten critically acclaimed mysteries, including the Callahan Garrity mystery series. A former reporter for the <em>Atlanta Journal Constitution</em>, she is also the author of <em>Little Bitty Lies</em> and the Edgar�- and Macavity-nominated <em>Savannah Blues</em>, under the name Mary Kay Andrews.</p>Everybody in Atlanta hates Whitney Albright Dobbs, the well- connected society matron who downed a brace of Tanquerays at her club, ran down eight-year-old Faneeta Mayes, and then got off with a fine and a hundred hours of community service (the highway trash patrol) thanks to a bleeding-heart lawyer who blamed everybody except his client. But even Whitney Dobbs deserves a fair shake now that she's not so well-connected anymore; her cardiologist husband Carson Dobbs, long separated from her and cloven to her replacement, has taken advantage of her legal troubles to squirrel away his assets and file for divorce. So when Whitney asks Callahan Garrity, p.i.-cum-house cleaner (Happy Never After, 1995, etc.), to go on a treasure hunt for her ex's family jewels, Callahan reluctantly takes the case. Her plan to insinuate her ailing but indomitable mother into Dr. Dobbs's practice as a patient and to mobilize her staff at The House Mouse to spy on the good doctor is just bearing its first fruits when Whitney and another member of the highway cleaning patrol are shotgunned and stuffed into the roadside trash. Was the killer the heart-specialist husband, one of Faneeta Mayes's distraught parents, or just one of the dozens of picketers who'd been calling for Whitney's blood up till the day of her death? Callahan's fifth is conscientiously plotted, if the waves upon waves of witnesses don't wear out your patience. (Regional author tour) -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

No parent with a beating heart can long endure the notion of being eternally separated from the child they love. It was this concern that prompted Edward Lawrence, a 17th century Puritan pastor, to write this booklet to his own children. In 7 short chapters he shows them his loving heart and desire for their salvation and provides practical exhortations to parents. He does not blame parents necessarily for the spiritual condition of their unsaved children, but he does suggest directions for nurturing them towards Christ.</p><p>Kistler is the founder and president of Soli Deo Gloria Ministries, Inc.</p><h2>Friendship Fires</h2><p>Sam Cook's writing has brought readers home to the north country for almost two decades.

The Scots retaliated and the two countries were plunged into 300 years of war in which the Borderland became the frontline and raiding, or &#34;reiving,&#34; encouraged by both sides, became a way of life. Keith Durham examines the Border fortresses, ranging from small, well-defended castles to imposing tower houses, or &#34;peles,&#34; and a variety of fortified farmhouses known as &#34;bastles.&#34; He also investigates the many churches that were strengthened against attack and in times of trouble served as sanctuaries for their congregations.</p><p>Keith Durham is the author of Men-at-Arms 279: The Border Reivers.

A Gypsy who made his jazz guitar speak with a human voice, he was dashing, charismatic, childish . . . and doomed to die young after creating a legacy of Gypsy Jazz that remains vibrant today.<br>&nbsp;<br>Gypsy Jazz is a music both joyous and sad, timeless and modern. It was born from a marriage of Louis Armstrong&#x2019;s trumpet with the anguished sound of Romany violin and the fire of flamenco guitar. Created amidst the glamour of Jazz Age Paris and reaching a peak during the horrors of World War II, Gypsy Jazz gave a voice to a dispossessed people. Today, Gypsy Jazz is more popular than ever.

Packer blends outrageous humor with sound advice as he guides readers through the mysterious world of manners from A ("Applause") to Z ("Zits").<br><br> He starts by explaining why etiquette is important&#x2014;because people who know how to handle themselves in social situations come out on top, get what they want, feel good about themselves, and enjoy life to the fullest. Fourteen chapters describe the basics of polite behavior in all kinds of situations at home, in school, and in the world.<br><br> Teens learn how to be a host with the most (and a guest with the best), what to do (and not do) when going online or waiting in line, how to deal with rude relatives, how to act at the mall and the concert hall, how to make introductions, who invented manners, and much more. Hundreds of "Dear Alex" questions and answers cover everything from dating to breaking up, thank-you notes to table manners, ethnic jokes to social cliques, skateboarding to celebrating. Survey results reveal what teens, parents, and teachers think about manners and why they're important.<br><br> Full of practical tips for every occasion, How Rude! is a serious etiquette encyclopedia&#x2014;and a hilarious read.<br></p><p>Alex J.

He is currently President of FCD Educational Services, a Boston-based provider of drug education and substance abuse prevention services to schools worldwide.Grade 6 Up?From its intriguing title to the tongue-in-cheek ideas for dealing with many kinds of situations, teenagers will find this manual humorous, nonthreatening, entertaining, and educational. The narrative is light and lively, and the advice is realistic and practical. The situations covered in the question-and-answer format far exceed those found in standard etiquette books, with section headings such as "Sex-Ediquette" (realistic rules for relationships with the opposite sex), Toiletiquette, (polite bathroom-sharing), and Netiquette (cyberspace behavior codes). The correct way to answer an invitation, which fork to use at a formal dinner, and all of the standard protocols for life in what once was called a "proper" environment are included. Yet there are many scenarios, from sexual situations to in-line skating, that will be relevant to today's teenagers, and questions that many would not be able to ask an adult, yet for which they urgently need answers. They will certainly find guidance here. Charts listing options for correct or incorrect behavior with probable outcomes appear throughout, as are anecdotal snippets entitled "True Stories from the Manners Frontier." Survey results that show what teens think and then what parents and teachers think about the same issues are presented. This volume should be considered ahead of any traditional etiquette book for YAs. They will return to it again and again as they face new and different situations.?Marilyn Fairbanks, East Junior High School, Brockton, <br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Let Me Entertain You</h2><p>Recalling his luminous life as a movie producer, the architect of Zanuck/ Brown Productions shares anecdotes from his career, including contacts with Robert Redford, Marilyn Monroe, Steven Spielberg, and others</p><p>David Brown has produced Broadway plays,k films and television.

Harking back to 1937, he tells about his debut in journalism on Women's Wear Daily , followed by a career that brought him in contact with memorable public figures such as mobster boss Frank Costello and the Mafia menace Estes Kefauver; Khrushchev, Howard Hughes et al. At his pseudo-modest heights, Brown describes how Helen Gurley, after persuading him to take a third wife, became Helen Gurley Brown, author ( Sex and the Single Girl ) and formidable editor of Cosmopolitan.

She explores the somewhat deflated world of post-revolutionary Prague, guides us through the labyrinthine New York art world of the eighties, and takes us behind the one-way mirror of Salvador Minuchin's school of family therapy.And to each subject she brings the incisive skepticism and dazzling epigrammatic style that are her hallmarks.<br><br>&#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t more people write like [Malcolm]?...

But what if the most common beliefs about how creativity works are wrong? <i>Group Genius</i> tears down some of the most popular myths about creativity, revealing that creativity is <i>always</i> collaborative-even when you're alone. Sharing the results of his own acclaimed research on jazz groups, theater ensembles, and conversation analysis, Keith Sawyer shows us how to be more creative in collaborative group settings, how to change organizational dynamics for the better, and how to tap into our own reserves of creativity.</p><p><b>Keith Sawyer</b> is an associate professor of psychology at Washington University in St. Louis. He is the author of the textbook <i>Explaining Creativity: The Science of Human Innovation</i>, has designed video games for Atari, and lectures frequently to both academic and business audiences. He lives in St. Louis, Missouri.Forget about the myth of the solitary genius: collaborative effort generates ideas and inventions, says this useful, upbeat book about how innovation always emerges from a series of sparks&#x2014;never a single flash of insight. Judiciously wielding exercises and dozens of examples, Sawyer <i>(Explaining Creativity) </i>helps the reader understand how people think and function in and out of groups. He looks at how J.R.R. Tolkien and C.S. Lewis composed their epic novels in concert, how unorganized individuals can come together to provide disaster relief more efficiently than government planners, how Charles Darwin and Samuel Morse built their work on others' discoveries, how information sharing helped Silicon Valley beat out Boston's computer startups. (Sawyer's riffs on jazz ensembles and improv comedy as sites of ingenuity are less convincing.) Basing much of his work on that of mentor Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi&#x2014;who writes about reaching the state of heightened consciousness he calls flow&#x2014;Sawyer offers guidelines for creating group flow. Insisting that collaborative webs are more important than creative people, he calls for an organizational culture that fosters equivocality, improvised innovation, and constant conversation&#x2014;that's a recipe for group genius. Even if few readers are in a position to do away with their organizational chart, this is a solid recipe for unexpected innovation. <i>(June)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

We whitewashed the brick exterior and grew privet hedges around the front edge of the yard and down the sides, trying to grow them tall and unruly and impenetrable to the eyes of people driving by. We put in white board fences and a potting shed and a kitchen garden. We hunkered down behind the hedges and piped opera out the window into the backyard and generally did our best to live as though Rosamunde Pilcher and Miss Jane Marple were just around the corner instead of a Wal-Mart.<br>One April evening we sat in the yard enjoying a golden sunset, a particular moment we both clearly recall. Surrounded by the first fresh blooms of the lower garden, we were watching the goldfinches come to the feeders. We talked about how good it was going to be to have a summer where we were only maintaining the garden instead of building it, to have a chance to sit and enjoy the season rather than work so hard. We both recall a gentle breeze that evening we thought was the leading edge of a warm front we hoped might bring us a welcome shower. The gentle breeze turned out to be the front edge of the winds of change. My children were coming.<br><br>The complete story of how the two of us became the four of us is complicated, and some of it is not even mine to tell. In those days we saw my two young children on Thursday evenings and every other weekend and at holidays. But a fast-moving and surprising series of circumstances and conversations conspired to produce our invitation for them to come to live with us. It was not something we ever planned on doing, but it seemed the right thing when we did it, and it seems the right thing these years later. When they said yes, our world changed very quickly.<br>Within a few days, we put the suburban house on the market and sold it. We started looking for a house large enough to hold us all, in a neighborhood where the children would be zoned to the schools we all agreed were the right ones for them. We found a circa 1910 cottage in an old Victorian-style neighborhood in the heart of the city, a neighborhood called Sunnyside, no less. Ms. Pilcher and Ms. Marple would have been pleased. Within another month, we were packed up and moved. We had an old house to live in and a new home to make.<br><br>&#x201c;The journey through time...is a journey in search,&#x201d; wrote Frederick Buechner. &#x201c;We search for a self to be. We search for other selves to love. We search for work to do.&#x201d; Our search for those things often leads us to places we never imagined we would go, places we never imagined we would live. Not very many of us live in the same neighborhood or the same city or the same state we grew up in.<br>The nature of the society in which we live has most of us on the move most of the time&#x2014;from job to job, town to town, and all too often from relationship to relationship. Being transplanted is something that happens one way or another to most all of us. Putting down new roots is not<br>always an easy thing to do. The roots from which we came are often buried deeply in soil that we have long since left, or at least most of us have. We go back to visit from time to time&#x2014;holidays,<br>reunions, weddings, funerals, and other moments in which milestones are marked. The older we get, the truer it is that some of the people who put down the roots from which we grew are gone now. They have joined the crowd of folks &#x201c;whom we have loved but no longer see,&#x201d; as the old prayer books call them.<br>We visit our roots, one might say, but the truth is that someone else planted those roots. We grew up, and we went away to find our own futures, make our own homes, and put down our own roots. Wherever we went away to, we are the ones who must do the digging in.<br>We search for our own selves, for work to call our own, and for others to love. If we are to have any roots at all, we must find them in the places where we are now, on this day. If we are to make a home, if we are to deeply belong to the places in which we find ourselves, we must dig ourselves<br>in somehow. It is in such digging in that we can most tenderly recall the places we came from, most deeply appreciate where we are, and most clearly see who we may yet become. How well we fulfill our dreams and hopes for a place to belong might just come down to how well we tend to the life that is lived in our own backyard. Whether our place is large or small, urban or rural, our first home or our last, a cottage or a condo, these are the places where we must put down roots.<br><br><i>Bloom Where You Are Planted </i>was the title of a book I readwhen I was a teenager.

She rather chose to be in control of her own emotions and her own life, such as it was.</p><p>At the age of eighteen she had chosen to marry William Keeping, a neighboring gentleman of sober address and steady habits and modest means, after he had very properly called upon her father to make his offer and had then made her a very civil marriage proposal in the presence of her father&#x2019;s second wife. Agnes had been fond of her husband and comfortable with him for almost five years before he died of one of his frequent winter chills. She had mourned him with an empty sort of desolation for longer than the requisite year of wearing her black widow&#x2019;s weeds and still sadly missed him.</p><p>She had not been in love with him, however, or he with her. The very idea seemed absurd, suggestive as it was of a wild, unbridled sort of passion.</p><p>She smiled at her image in the glass as she tried to imagine poor William in an unbridled passion, romantic or otherwise. But then her eyes focused upon herself, and it occurred to her that she had better admire her splendor now while she had the chance, for once she arrived at the ball, it would be instantly apparent that in reality she did not look very magnificent at all.</p><p>She was wearing her green silk evening gown, which she loved despite the fact that it was far from new&#x2014;indeed, she had had it when William was still alive&#x2014;and had not been in the height of fashion even when it was. It was high waisted with a moderately low neckline and short puffy sleeves and was embroidered with silver thread about the hem and the edges of the sleeves. It was not shabby despite its age. One did not, after all, wear one&#x2019;s best evening gown very often, unless one moved in far more elevated social circles than Agnes did. She had been living for several months now in a modest cottage in the village of Inglebrook in Gloucestershire with her elder sister, Dora.</p><p>Agnes had never attended a ball before. She had been to assemblies, of course, and it could be argued that a ball was the same thing by another name. But really there was a world of difference. Assemblies were held in public halls, usually above an inn. Balls were private entertainments hosted by those rich and socially prominent enough to inhabit a house with a ballroom. Such people and such houses did not abound in the English countryside.</p><p>There was one close by, however.</p><p>Middlebury Park, a mere mile from Inglebrook, was a stately mansion belonging to Viscount Darleigh, husband of Agnes&#x2019;s new and dear friend, Sophia. The long wing east of the massive central block housed the state apartments, which were dazzlingly magnificent&#x2014;or so they had appeared to Agnes when Sophia had given her a tour one afternoon not long after they first met. They included a spacious ballroom.</p><p>The viscount had succeeded to his title when his uncle and cousin died a sudden and violent death together, and it was only now, four years later, that Middlebury Park had again become the social center of the neighborhood. Lord Darleigh had been blinded at the age of seventeen when he was an artillery officer in the Peninsular Wars, two years before the title and property and fortune became his. He had lived a retired life at Middlebury until he met and married Sophia in London in the late spring of this year, just before Agnes herself moved to the neighborhood. His marriage and perhaps a growing maturity had instilled in the viscount a confidence he had apparently lacked before, and Sophia herself had set about the task of assisting him and at the same time making a new life for herself as mistress of a large home and estate.</p><p>Hence the ball.</p><p>The two of them were reviving the old tradition of a harvest ball, which had always been held early in October. It was being spoken of in the village, however, as more of a wedding dance and reception than a harvest celebration, for the viscount and his wife had married quietly in London a mere week after they met, and there had been no public celebration of their nuptials. Even their families had not been in attendance. Sophia had promised soon after she arrived at Middlebury that a reception would be held at some time in the foreseeable future, and this ball was it, despite the fact that Sophia was already increasing, a condition that could no longer be quite hidden despite the current fashion for dresses with loosely flowing skirts. Everyone in the neighborhood knew, even though no official announcement had been made.</p><p>It was no exclusive honor to have been invited to the ball, for almost everyone else from the village and the surrounding countryside had been invited too. And Dora had quite a close connection with the viscount and his wife, since she gave both of them pianoforte lessons as well as instruction in the violin and harp to Lord Darleigh. Agnes had been Sophia&#x2019;s friend ever since they had discovered a mutual passion for art, Agnes as a watercolorist, Sophia as a very clever caricaturist and illustrator of children&#x2019;s stories.</p><p>There were to be other, more illustrious guests at the ball than just the people from the neighborhood, however. Lord Darleigh&#x2019;s sisters and their husbands were coming, as well as Viscount Ponsonby, one of the viscount&#x2019;s friends. Sophia had explained that the two men were part of a group of seven persons who had spent several years together in Cornwall recovering from various war wounds. Most of them had been military officers. They called themselves the Survivors&#x2019; Club and spent a few weeks of each year in company with one another.</p><p>Sophia had family members coming too: her uncle Sir Terrence Fry, a senior government diplomat, and another uncle and aunt&#x2014;Sir Clarence and Lady March&#x2014;with their daughter.</p><p>It all sounded very imposing and had Agnes looking forward to it with something bordering on excitement. She had never thought of herself as a person who coveted social splendor, just as she did not think of herself as someone who would ever fall in love. But she was eagerly anticipating this ball, perhaps because Sophia herself was, and Agnes had grown very fond of her young friend. She earnestly wanted the ball to be a great success for Sophia&#x2019;s sake.</p><p>She looked critically at her hair, which she had dressed herself. She had managed to coax some height out of her curls and had left a few tendrils to wave along her neck and over her ears. The style could hardly be called elaborate, nonetheless. And there was nothing remarkable about the hair itself, a nondescript midbrown color, though it did have a healthy shine to it. There was nothing particularly remarkable about the face beneath the hair either, she thought, smiling ruefully at her image. She was not ugly, it was true. Perhaps she was not even quite plain. But she was no ravishing beauty. And, good heavens, had she ever wanted to be? This going-to-a-ball business was turning her head and making her giddy.</p><p>She and Dora arrived early, as most of the outside guests did. Being late was fashionable with the ton during the Season in London, Dora had commented when they set out ten minutes earlier than the early start they had planned. Or so she had heard. But in the country people tended to have better manners. So they were early.</p><p>Agnes was feeling rather breathless by the time they reached the doors of the ballroom. The state apartments looked somehow different and far more magnificent with banks of flowers and hanging baskets everywhere and candles blazing from every wall sconce.</p><p>Sophia was standing just inside the double doors, receiving her guests with Lord Darleigh beside her, and Agnes instantly relaxed and smiled with genuine warmth. Although she did not expect to fall in love herself, she could not deny that such a state existed and that it could be beautiful to behold when it did. Lord and Lady Darleigh positively glowed with a romantic affection for each other, though they never openly demonstrated their feelings in public.</p><p>Sophia looked gorgeous in a turquoise gown that perfectly complemented her auburn hair. That hair had been boyishly short when she was first married. She had been growing it ever since. It was still not long, but her maid had done something clever with it to make it look sleek and elegant, and for the first time it struck Agnes that her friend was more than just pretty in an elfin kind of way. She beamed at Dora and Agnes and hugged them both, and Lord Darleigh, blind though he was, seemed to look directly at them with his very blue eyes as he smiled and shook them by the hand.</p><p>&#x201c;Mrs. Keeping, Miss Debbins,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;how very kind of you to come to make our evening perfect.&#x201d;</p><p>As though his guests were the ones doing him a favor. He was looking elegant and handsome in black and white.</p><p>It was not difficult to pick out the strangers in the ballroom. One result of living in the country, even when one had been here for only a few months, was that one tended to see the same people wherever one went. And the strangers had brought high fashion with them and quite cast Agnes&#x2019;s best green gown into the shade, as she had fully expected. They outshone everyone else too, except one another.</p><p>Mrs. Hunt, the viscount&#x2019;s mother, kindly undertook to take Dora and Agnes about to introduce them, first to Sir Clarence and Lady March and Miss March, all of whom were looking very distinguished indeed, even if the height of Lady March&#x2019;s hair plumes was rather startling. They nodded with stiff condescension&#x2014;the plumes too&#x2014;and Agnes followed Dora&#x2019;s lead and curtsied. Then there were Sir Terrence Fry and Mr. Sebastian Maycock, his stepson, both of whom were smartly but not ostentatiously clad. The former bowed politely to them and remarked upon the prettiness of the village. The latter, a tall, handsome, personable-looking young gentleman, flashed his teeth at them and pronounced himself to be delighted. He hoped to engage them in some dancing later in the evening, though he did not make any definite appointment with either of them.</p><p>A charmer, Agnes decided, but more enamored of his own charms than other people&#x2019;s. And she really ought not to indulge in such unkind snap judgments when she had almost nothing upon which to base them.</p><p>And then Mrs. Hunt presented them to Viscount Ponsonby, whose immaculately formal evening clothes, all black except for the pristine white of his linen and intricately tied neck cloth and the silver of his waistcoat, set every other man present into the shade except perhaps Viscount Darleigh himself. He was tall and well formed, a blond god of a man, though his hair was not the white blond or the yellow blond that never looked quite right on a man, in Agnes&#x2019;s opinion. His features were classically perfect, his eyes decidedly green. There was a certain world-weariness to those eyes, and the suggestion of mockery in the set of his lips. One long-fingered hand held a silver-handled quizzing glass.</p><p>Agnes felt annoyingly aware of her own ordinariness. And though he did not raise his glass to his eye when Mrs. Hunt introduced them&#x2014;he was, she sensed, far too well mannered to do any such thing&#x2014;she felt nevertheless that she had been thoroughly inspected and dismissed, despite the fact that he bowed to both Dora and herself and asked them how they did and even paid attention to their less than scintillating answers.</p><p>He was the sort of man who always made Agnes uncomfortable, though she had not met many such, it was true. For such stunningly handsome and attractive men made her feel dull and plodding as well as very ordinary, and she always ended up despising herself. How did she want to appear to such men? As an empty-headed eyelid-flutterer? Or as sophisticated and witty, perhaps? What utter nonsense.</p><p>She could not get away from him quickly enough in order to feel like herself again as she spoke with Mr. and Mrs. Latchley and commiserated with the former, who had fallen off the roof of his barn only the week before and broken his leg. He could not sufficiently praise Lord and Lady Darleigh, who had paid him a personal visit and insisted upon sending their own carriage to bring him and his wife to the ball and had even coaxed them into staying the night before being conveyed back home on the morrow.</p><p>Agnes looked around with great enjoyment as they talked. The wooden floor had been polished to a high gloss. There were large pots of autumn-hued flowers everywhere. Three large chandeliers, all the candles alight, hung from a ceiling painted with scenes from mythology. They glinted off the gilded frieze above the wood paneling of the walls and reflected in the many long mirrors, which made the already spacious room look many times larger and many times fuller of flowers and guests. The members of the orchestra&#x2014;yes, there was actually an eight-piece orchestra come all the way from Gloucester&#x2014;had taken their places on the dais at one end of the room and were tuning their instruments.</p><p>Everyone, it seemed, had arrived. Lord Darleigh and Sophia had turned into the room, and Sir Terrence Fry was making his way toward them with the obvious intention of leading his niece out for the first set of country dances. Agnes smiled. It was also amusing to watch the Marches maneuver themselves closer to Viscount Ponsonby. It was very clear that they intended him to partner Miss March for the first set. It was doubly amusing to watch him stroll unhurriedly away from them without even glancing in their direction. He was clearly a gentleman accustomed to avoiding unwelcome advances. Oh, she must share this with Sophia when she next saw her after tonight. Sophia was wickedly good at sketching caricatures.</p><p>Agnes was so busy observing the look of chagrin on the faces of all three Marches that she did not notice at first that Viscount Ponsonby was moving in the direction of the sofa along which Mr. Latchley&#x2019;s splinted leg was stretched. Except that he was not coming to commiserate or even to nod a greeting to the injured man. Instead he stopped and bowed to her.</p><p>&#x201c;Mrs. Keeping,&#x201d; he said, his voice languid, even a trifle bored, &#x201c;one is expected to d-dance, I believe, at such gatherings. At least, that is what my friend Darleigh informed me this afternoon. And although he is quite b-blind and one might assume he would not see if I did not dance, I know him well enough to feel quite c-certain that he would see even if no one told him. What is the point of having a blind friend, I sometimes ask myself, if one cannot deceive him in such matters?&#x201d;</p><p>Oh, he stuttered slightly&#x2014;surely his only outward imperfection. His eyelids partly drooped over his eyes as he spoke to give him his slightly sleepy look, though the eyes themselves did not look sleepy at all.</p><p>Agnes laughed. She did not know what else to do. Was he asking her to dance? But he had not said so, had he?</p><p>&#x201c;Ah,&#x201d; he said, raising his quizzing glass almost but not quite to his eye. He had beautifully manicured nails, she saw, on a hand that was nevertheless quite unmistakably male. &#x201c;Quite so. You s-sympathize with me, I see. But one must dance. Will you do me the honor, ma&#x2019;am, of hoofing it about the floor with me?&#x201d;</p><p>He was asking her to dance, and the opening set at that. She had been hoping quite fervently that someo...</p></p><h2>The Orient-Express</h2><p>Abruptly leaving his American wife, job, and home, a European-born tycoon purchases a ticket for the famed Orient Express and, as he rides across Europe, muses on the differences between Europe as it is and Europe as he remembers it.</p><p>Gregor von Rezzori was born in the Bukovina in 1914.

Before war began in Europe, Berlin had already placed contracts for a massive surface navy and four-engine bombers that could cross the Atlantic. Norman J. W. Goda traces the documentary evidence of Germany's long-term plans to extend its conquests to America. <br><br> This cogently argued book focuses on Germany's secret efforts to gain base sites for the new navy and long-range bombers in French North West Africa, Spain's Canary Islands, and Portugal's Azores and Cape Verde Islands. During this period Hitler rated the base issue a higher priority than the efficient prosecution of the war against Great Britain and second only to the Eastern Campaign. <br><br> In the end, Berlin failed to gain base sites. The effort antagonized Spain and France, pushing them away from a more actively pro-German stance. Germany also misjudged America's capability to capture the sites and consequently left Northwest Africa relatively unprepared for the Allied invasion of 1942. <br><br> Goda questions both the traditional notion that Germany operated from an unplanned opportunism and the argument that its territorial demands were limited to the European continent. His close reading of diplomatic and military archives opens new windows on Franco's Spain and P�tain's France. By focusing on policy formulation and implementation at the political and diplomatic level, he adds evidence for the view that Hitler's ambitions were not just talk but the basis for concrete military plans. <br><br></p><p>Did Adolf Hitler's Germany have designs on the Western Hemisphere? As early as the 1920s Hitler had repeatedly argued that the Nordic struggle for racial dominance would become worldwide, but his thoughts regarding the United States were sometimes obscured by his aims in Europe. In Tomorrow the World, Norman J. W. Goda retraces the documentary evidence to demonstrate that Germany's long-term strategy, developed early in World War II, pointed toward the United States following the expected conquest of the European continent.<p>Even before the war in Europe began, Berlin had placed contracts for a massive surface navy, and a transatlantic bomber was also in the process of development. This cogently argued, well-written book focuses primarily on Germany's secret efforts to gain base sites for these new weapons in French North and West Africa, Spain's Canary Islands, and Portugal's Azores and Cape Verde Islands. These efforts began with the surrender of France in June 1940 and ended with the Allied invasion of North Africa in November 1942. During this period, Hitler rated the base issue a higher priority than the efficient prosecution of the war against Great Britain and second only to the Eastern Campaign.</p><p>In the end, Berlin's policy failed to gain the desired base sites and also antagonized the Spanish and French governments, pushing each away from a more actively pro-German stance. Meanwhile, German military and naval intelligence misjudged the American capability of capturing the sites; thus Northwest Africa was left relatively unprepared for the Allied invasion of 1942.</p><p>Goda questions both the more traditional interpretations that Hitler's Germany operated from unplannedopportunism and that its aims were confined to the European continent. His extremely close reading of the diplomatic and military sources from German, Spanish, and French records also opens new windows on the policies of Franco's Spain and Petain's France. By focusing on policy formulation and implementation at the political and diplomatic level, he adds substantial evidence for the view that Hitler's ambitions were not just grandiose table talk, but formed the basis for concrete military plans and building projects.</p><p>Military historians and scholars of World War II will welcome this assiduously researched and well-crafted study for the light it throws on some of the classic arguments of the period.</p>NORMAN J.

But The Ice Virgin, the most disturbing, ambitious, and searching of all of Andersen&#x2019;s narratives, is also a thoroughly absorbing story of the real world. Andersen here is writing about a world he saw as something of a paradigm of the human condition, and this lies behind the story&#x2019;s multilayered complexity.This splendid new translation by Paul Binding and his erudite and comprehensive afterword together make a compelling case for just why The Ice Virgin deserves to be placed in the first rank of world literature.</p><p><b>Paul Binding </b>is a literary critic, novelist, and a renowned expert in Scandinavian literature who has been involved in the promotion of Scandinavian culture for more than twenty years. After spending his early childhood in Germany, he returned to be educated in England and studied English literature at Oxford University.

Among his books are studies of Ibsen, Lorca, Robert Louis Stevenson, Eudora Welty, and Hans Christian Andersen, and the translation from the Danish of The Overlook Press&#x2019;s edition of <i>The Ice Virgin</i>.&#x201c;We tend to think of Hans Christian Andersen as a writer for the young. As it happens, Denmark&#x2019;s greatest storyteller also brought his vivid prose style to bear in works for adults, and his gifts are on display in Paul Binding&#x2019;s new translation of&nbsp;<em>The Ice Virgin</em>&nbsp;. . . At once sparkling and frighteningly deep, like the glaciers that cut through the mountain passes of Switzerland in the 1850s . . . &nbsp;<em>The Ice Virgin</em>&nbsp;marshals both surface and subterranean effects; we feel huge things moving beneath the crust of events. Andersen&#x2019;s writing is a joy. Several times I had to put the book down to recover from his exquisite descriptions of the Swiss landscape . . . Nothing in this tale makes it inappropriate for younger readers&#x2015;there&#x2019;s no bodice ripping or gory details&#x2015;but older ones are likelier to find resonance in Andersen&#x2019;s ambiguous, sophisticated vision.&nbsp;&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Meghan Cox Gurdon, <em>The Wall Street Journal</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Striking the perfect balance between fairy tale atmosphere and eerie narrative for the adult reader, Paul Binding&#x2019;s new translation of Hans Christian Andersen&#x2019;s&nbsp;<em>The Ice Virgin</em>&nbsp;vividly depicts the eternal struggle between the forces of nature and the forces within ourselves.

He lives just outside Thirsk in North Yorkshire.James Herriot, author of ALL CREATURES GREAT AND SMALL and other books, is probably the world's most famous veterinarian. In real life, the author was Alf Wight, an unassuming country vet in Scotland with a talent for writing. His son, Jim Wight, has written a readable and interesting biography of his father. Readers of ALL CREATURES who don't know much about Alf Wight will enjoy this look behind the pages. They'll discover the real Siegfried Farnon and his brother, Tristan. But to readers who already know a bit about the author, Jim Wight breaks little new ground. The reader is Christopher Timothy, the lead actor in the TV series "All Creatures Great and Small" and the reader of the audio versions of several Herriot works. He does a solid, even engaging job. But he's so clearly identified as James Herriot, it can be a bit disorienting when he says something like "my father," and means James, and not James's father.

His many other books include the epic fantasies Oath of Swords and The War God&#39;s Own (also Baen).The fourth Honor Harrington novel is definitely the best in this increasingly popular military-sf series. Honor's old nemesis, Pavel Young, takes revenge on her for having him dismissed from the navy by hiring a duelist to kill her lover. This swiftly brings upon him a dire and vividly described fate, which puts Honor on half-pay on the planet Grayson, where she is a feudal magnate. Honor has always been as much a descendant of the Superperson as of C. S. Forester's very human Horatio Hornblower, but Weber has thought enough about her so that, when the time came to produce a character-driven military-sf novel, he could do so quite handsomely. That time is now, and these are a new Honor and a new Weber. With the war against the People's Republic of Haven clearly destined to last as long as the Napoleonic Wars after which it is modeled, expect to see more of both. <i>Roland Green</i></p><h2>The Mcdougall Program for a Healthy Heart: A Life-Saving Approach to Preventing and Treating Heart Disease</h2><p>Utilizing an innovative approach to diet, exercise, and lifestyle to prevent and treat heart disease, this up-to-date guide offers a twelve-day menu plan, more than one hundred healthful recipes, advice on how to break bad habits, and tips on setting realistic exercise goals. 100,000 first printing.

McDougall, M.D. is the founder and director of the McDougall Program at St. Helena Hospital in the Napa Valley of California.Making a strong pitch for the vegan lifestyle, McDougall (The McDougall Program for Maximum Weight Loss) freely criticizes mainstream medicine for scanting nutritional advice. Unlike the modest dietary changes recommended by such authorities as the Texas Heart Institute (see above), McDougall, who runs a cardiac program at St. Helena Hospital in California's Napa Valley, bans all animal products-fish, poultry, eggs, even nonfat dairy-from his no-cholesterol, under-10%-fat diet. Though the emphasis is primarily on nutrition (two weeks of menu plans, 100 recipes and extensive brand-name shopping lists are provided), McDougall also discusses exercise and stress management, medications and surgical procedures and offers plenty of cautionary words on diagnostic tests. Peppering his lively prose with anecdotes, McDougall is persuasive and upbeat about his program's success in preventing as well as treating heart disease, but his demanding regime will likely appeal most to the highly motivated, especially those already experiencing heart problems. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Selected Translations</h2><p><p>"Mr. Merwin is an undisputed master." <i>The New York Times</i></p><p> This collection of W.

Merwin<br><br>[Excerpted from unedited draft: NOT FOR PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION]<br><br>More than once, during the sixty years and more that are represented by this present selection, I had persuaded myself that I had finished trying to translate poetry. I had not come to that as a firm decision, but as a prospect whose time seemed to have come. But I kept finding that I had returned, after all, to trying again. Sometimes I had been led to it by a suggestion from someone else, and other times by something perhaps a single line or phrase that suddenly caught me, in the original, a line or phrase with which I had long been familiar. The indecisiveness about it, I realize, is consistent with the impossible art of translating poetry at all, for there is no such thing as a final translation. Only the original is unique, and essentially it cannot exist in other words.&#x201d; And one part of the impossibility of translating it is the fact that what we want every translation to be is exactly what it never can be: the original. Yet the impossibility of the whole attempt remained part of the temptation to try again.<br><br>This magnetic attraction came to seem natural&#x201d; to me, as habits do. It seemed to have grown there on its own, a native. It must have evolved from my own early fascination with the sound of language, which I am convinced is innate in everyone, whether it reaches maturity or not. In societies with strong oral traditions it is taken for granted. When I became aware of it I was too young to try to describe it even to myself. I remember being intrigued by phrases with an unfamiliar sound, in poems that my mother read to my sister and me, and in hymns that were sung, above my head in church (my father was a Presbyterian minister, so we went to church regularly). The sound of Tennyson&#x2019;s brook babbling, babbling as it went to join the brimming river, and the spacious firmament on high, and all the blue ethereal sky which seemed clear to me though the actual words did not. One day before I went to school, at four, my father took me down to the church with him, a block away, to sit there while he rehearsed his next Sunday&#x2019;s sermon. I was to sit very quietly and listen. My father did not often ask me to come along with him when he went out, and it was something of an occasion for me. First he read from the scripture, from the sixth chapter of the Book of Isaiah. My father, I am happy to say, always read in the King James version, and I heard:<br><br>In the year that King Uz-ziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple.<br><br>Above it stood the seraphim; each one had six sings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly <br><br>Even in my father&#x2019;s readings from the pulpit I did not remember ever having heard language like that, and it rang in my ears. I wanted to hear that sound again, and to hear more of the life in the words, though I had only a remote sense of what the words meant, as I did sometimes when my mother read fairy tales to us. As we walked home I kept trying to remember phrases, mumbling them to myself under my breath .<br> <br> when I had turned nineteen, a friend invited me to his family&#x2019;s house in Washington D.C. during the Easter vacation, and while I was there I telephoned St. Elizabeth&#x2019;s, the military hospital where Pound was incarcerated, to ask whether I could visit him. They consented, and he consented.<br><br>I was led in through a locked door to a large shabby room that seemed to have been made by knocking out partitions between a series of former rooms. It had all been painted a grayish green at some point in the past, and the paint looked as thought it came from an unrecorded age. The walls were broken into insets and alcoves and I was led into one of the larger ones, just inside the iron-clad entrance door. There were heavy metal grids inside the tall windows. I was shown to a chair, and Pound, a moment later, was led in and over to meet me. He greeted me with a friendly laugh and we sat facing each other. He must have been sixty, if my dates are right, but he looked older to me. Thin, rather gaunt, his hair and the pointed beard gray. When he laughed he threw his head back revealing rows of gold teeth. He made no reference to his circumstances, ignoring one of the inmates, in pyjamas, who walked slowly up and down the length of the room, past us, pausing to pull, apparently an imaginary chain, maybe a toilet chain. Pound said, So you&#x2019;re a poet.&#x201d; I told him that I hoped so. He nodded as though he were taking that under serious consideration, and he asked whether I had read any of his Cantos. I said only the first few, and he began to tell me about the plan for their final form, when the last cantos would complete the original design, holding all the others in place, like the frieze over the top of a row of columns he mimed what he meant with his hands in front of him.<br><br>He returned before long, to the subject of my own aspirations, and I explained more or less how they had led me to want to come and see him. He nodded like a teacher and proceeded to talk to me as though he took my words seriously. I realized then and later that he loved the role of the pedagogue. Gertrude Stein had said, Ezra is a village explainer, which is all right if you&#x2019;re a village, but &#x201d; Some of the advice he gave me was unforgettable and has been valuable to me ever since. He said, If you&#x2019;re going to be a poet you have to forget about inspiration,&#x201d; and work at it every day. Try to write seventy-five lines a day. Now, at your age, you don&#x2019;t have anything to write seventy-five lines about, even if you think you do. So the thing to do is to get languages and translate.&#x201d; He asked me what languages I knew and I said a bit of Spanish, after a bit of high school Latin. He nodded and took it in without comment, and then he said, The Spanish is all right. Get the romancero. Those are closest to the source. But best of all is the Provencal. Try to get the Provencal. Those troubadours wrote closest to the music. They heard the music before the words sometimes, and sometimes they wrote the music too. The translation of it is not simple, but trying to do it will be the best teacher you will ever find. Translating will teach you your own language.&#x201d;<br><br>That was invaluable, and over the years that I have spent trying to make translations, his words accompanied conclusions that I came to as I worked.

To hope hard for a comeback and then receive it in thrilling fashion in 1986? To experience the constant ups and downs the Mets would dispense for the next two decades? To put ups with the Yankees right next door? To make the psychic journey from Shea Stadium to Citi Field? To sort the myths from the realities?

A 17-year-old girl wakes up in what appears to be a white coffin&#x2014;surrounded by other 17-year-olds, half of whom are dead in their coffins. The macabre situation gets stranger because those who did survive can&#x2019;t quite remember their names or their histories, nor do they understand why they have strange symbols marked on their foreheads. Are they underground? Why is the tunnel they follow seemingly endless? And is anyone else alive? When they encounter another group of semi-adults, battles for leadership ensue, and those with the same symbols band together. But they are slowly becoming aware there is something else out there, and they will survive only if they stick together. Sigler balances the yin of high-octane shocks that come around each curve of the tunnel with the yang of Sun Tzu-like wisdom on tactics and leadership that have been mysteriously embedded in the mind of the main character, Em. As Em leads her survivors toward&#x2014;she hopes&#x2014;freedom, we stay on edge until the last page.

Now Douglas W. Druick, Searle curator of European paintings at The Art Institute of Chicago, has gathered more than 500 color and black-and-white reproductions of the artist&#39;s well-known and more obscure works.</p><p>Meticulous research by an international team of scholars, complemented by magnificently reproduced illustrations, creates an impressive portrait of the fin-de-si&#x160;cle French artist Odilon Redon (18401916). Although Redon was once ranked with artists like Seurat and Gauguin, he has lately received less attention than his peers--a situation that the current retrospective at the Art Institute of Chicago, which this volume explicates, should help redress. Redon is best remembered today for his visionary monochromatic prints and drawings. Among his most frequently exhibited pictures are such fantastic dream images as an eye set within an ascending balloon and a giant smiling spider poised at a jaunty angle. Many public collections also display colorful pastel drawings of flower bouquets from the latter part of his career. It has proven difficult to explain his work according to the grand narratives of art history. Redon was neither an impressionist nor a modernist; even the label of symbolist threatens to assimilate his works to literature and philosophy rather than grant them the independence that their singularity demands. The authors, led by the Art Institute's Druick, recontextualize Redon by carefully unraveling his relationship to the romantic esthetics, spiritualist theologies, and art-market imperatives of his time, while offering a convincing psychoanalytic account of how his art reflects his unhappy childhood, his difficult apprenticeship, and his struggle to emerge from the shadow of his talented elder brother. Dark clouds and landscapes from his early life mark his noirs, they argue, but dissolve to reveal the no less mysterious, but finally joyous, light and color of his last decades. Many heretofore unknown full-color images brought to light by their investigations give a fuller sense of the development of themes in this late period. A superb art book for aficionados of occult ideas, of the graphic arts, or simply of striking images and effusive colors. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Redon's art infuses us with wonder, pleasure, and hope. He survived a bewildering and painfully lonely childhood to become a productive, fulfilled, and successful artist--a transformation chronicled in his work, which evolved from stark iconographic depictions of isolation and vulnerability to vibrant images of luminous fecundity. Redon (1840-1916) was an exceptional draftsman, lithographer, pastelist, painter, and decorator, as well as a late bloomer and a wholly original thinker who found inspiration in diverse forms of art and literature and in the revolutionary realms of psychology and science. His work has been sadly neglected since his first retrospective 100 years ago, but his second retrospective has proved to be an exciting and revelatory event, as evidenced by this superb volume. Under the direction of Douglas W. Druick, a curator at the Art Institute of Chicago, a select group of art historians carefully and intuitively trace Redon's fascinating personal history and extraordinary artistic achievements. Nearly 600 reproductions, many of works hitherto unknown to the public, support the text and delight the eye. Redon's compelling work bridged the centuries, forming a golden chain of rich symbolism, glorious romance, gentle mysticism, and sensual celebration. <i>Donna Seaman</i></p><h2>Religion and the Rise of the American City: The New York City Mission Movement, 1812-1870</h2><p>Religion and the Rise of the American City: The New York City Mission Movement, 1812-1870 by Carroll Smith Rosenberg. 1971 hardcover published by Cornell University Press.</p><p></p><h2>The Gorilla Hunters: A Tale of the Wilds of Africa (R.

Based on thousands of previously unavailable documents, Andrew Lycett, author of the critically acclaimed biography Dylan Thomas, offers the first definitive biography of the baffling Conan Doyle, finally making sense of a long-standing mystery: how the scientifically minded creator of the world&#39;s most rational detective himself succumbed to an avid belief in spiritualism, including communication with the dead. Conan Doyle was a man of many contradictions. Always romantic, energetic, idealistic and upstanding, he could also be selfish and fool-hardy. Lycett assembles the many threads of Conan Doyle&#39;s life, including the lasting impact of his domineering mother and his wayward, alcoholic father; his affair with a younger woman while his wife lay dying; and his nearly fanatical pursuit of scientific data to prove and explain various supernatural phenomena. Lycett reveals the evolution of Conan Doyle&#39;s nature and ideas against the backdrop of his intense personal life, wider society and the intellectual ferment of his age. In response to the dramatic scientific and social transformations at the turn of the century, he rejected traditional religious faith in favor of psychics and seances - and in this way he embodied all of his late-Victorian, early-Edwardian era&#39;s ambivalence about the advance of science and the decline of religion. The first biographer to gain access to Conan Doyle&#39;s newly released personal archive - which includes correspondence, diaries, original manuscripts and more - Lycett combines assiduous research with penetrating insight to offer the most comprehensive, lucid and sympathetic portrait yet of Conan Doyle&#39;s personal journey from student to doctor, from world-famous</p><p><b>Andrew Lycett</b> studied history at Oxford University. After an early career as a foreign correspondent specializing in Africa and the Middle East, he now writes biographies. His lives of Dylan Thomas, Rudyard Kipling and Ian Fleming have been highly praised.<p>One</p><p><b>Two Irish Families</b></p><p>Molten lava and packed ice: even the natural forces that created Edinburgh's jagged landscape came in contrasting pairs. More than 300 million years ago one of the smouldering volcanoes that dotted the surrounding countryside erupted, making a series of crags, the tallest of which, serendipitously known as Arthur's Seat, now towers over the city. Later, vast glaciers ground their way through the lava-rich earth, shaping these contours and forming deep basins where today railways run instead of dinosaurs.</p><p>This was the ribbon of soaring pinnacles and perpendicular drops that Robert Louis Stevenson fondly recalled as his "precipitous city." For the full vertiginous effect, he probably also envisaged the steepling, overcrowded tenements or "lands" that spread upwards over what little space the cramped "crag and tail" topographical features permitted, so creating the high-rise skyline of Edinburgh's Old Town.</p><p>At ground level, a network of alleys or "wynds" led off the main Royal Mile. By the mid-eighteenth century, the stench, squalor and sheer numbers had become so insufferable that the professional classes leading the pragmatic intellectual movement known as the Scottish Enlightenment wanted somewhere more salubrious to live. After deciding on a solid sandstone ridge a mile away, they drained and bridged Nor'Loch, the inland lake that lay between, and hired a young architect, James Craig, to design a well ordered New Town, full of classical terraces and leafy squares.</p><p>As with the Old and New Town, so with Edinburgh in general. It is a city of dramatic contrasts, made tolerable by thoughtful accommodation. Here the ferocity of the outlying Highlands and Lowlands was blunted by the civilizing achievements of the Athens of the North. Here a Scottish fascination with witchcraft and the supernatural came under the skeptical gaze of scholars such as David Hume who congregated at the university. With his home city in mind, Stevenson wrote his classic fictional portrayal of schizophrenia, <i>The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</i>, drawing on Edinburgh's real-life Deacon Brodie -- respectable shopkeeper by day, infamous body theif by night. The only thing that remained constant was the bitter cold.</p><p>Arthur Conan Doyle was born at a slight tangent to this polarized world in Picardy Place, a quiet enclave off the main road out of town to Leith. Taking its name from the colony of linen-weavers who came there from France in 1729 to start a local industry, it played host to newer arrivals such as Arthur's parents, whose families hailed from Ireland and who enjoyed the security of living across the way from their co-religionists in the Roman Catholic church of St. Mary's.</p><p>Arthur himself came into the world early on May 22, 1859. His horoscope later put the exact time as 4:55 a.m., confirming that, in astrological terms, he was a Gemini, born under the sign of the twins, which was doubly appropriate, given the contrary nature of the city and his own future as a figure whose lifelong struggle to find some middle ground between the opposing nineteenth-century forces of spirituality and reason would provide such a fascinating commentary on his times.</p><p>In "The Adventure of the Greek Interpreter," Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson discuss the hoary question of "nature versus nurture." When Watson attributes his colleague's remarkable powers of observation and deduction to his "early systematic training," the detective agrees, but only up to a point, arguing that the real reason lies in his veins. Although his family were mainly country squires, "who appear to have led much the same life as is natural to their class," Holmes believes his special skills come from the artistic genes he inherited from his grandmother, a sister of the real-life French painter Horace Vernet. And "art in the blood is liable to take the strangest forms."</p><p>So it was with Arthur himself. His family was a source of pride and inspiration, particularly to a d�class� Celt anxious to position himself securely in socially stratified Anglo-centric society. But there were skeletons in the cupboard that were worrying to a scientist schooled in murky Victorian concepts of heredity.</p><p>Both sides of his family came from Ireland. But lineages are often hazy there, since so many records were lost in the civil war. At one stage Arthur was so convinced the Doyles were descended from Dubgall, King of Ulster, that he had a stained-glass window built at Undershaw, his house in Hindhead, showing several putative crests, including the Red Hand of Ulster. In fact, his surname meant little more than "dark stranger" or "foreigner," a reference to the king's Viking origins. He later dropped this idea and settled for the Doyles being a cadet branch of the Staffordshire family of that name who went to Ireland with the English invasion and spawned a large clan in County Wexford.</p><p>So far as the record extends, Arthur's grandfather John Doyle was a tailor's son who started professional life as an equestrian artist in Georgian Dublin. He won commissions from aristocratic patrons, including Lord Talbot, Lord Lieutenant during a politically turbulent period from 1817 to 1821, and the Second Marquess of Sligo.</p><p>One thing is indisputable -- the Doyles were devout Roman Catholics. Both John Doyle's sisters became nuns, and his brother James trained as a priest. As the Catholic journal The Month noted, John was the only child of the family who remained "in the world," and with this situation came a certain austerity -- a character trait emphasized by his height, bearing and angular patrician features. But his daunting demeanor was offset by a good nature and gentle Irish sense of humor.</p><p>In 1820 he married Marianna Conan, whose father also worked as a tailor in the Dublin rag trade. Again her antecedents are blurred, purportedly stretching back to the ancient ducal house of Britanny. Within a short time she had borne him a daughter, Annette. The start of a family was a signal for John Doyle to think seriously about his career. Following the Union of Great Britain and Ireland, educated Irishmen of his type began to look to London as a cultural as well as political capital. At the same time Irish Catholics were making inroads into the discriminatory legislation that barred them from political office.</p><p>Ambitious and pragmatic, Doyle made the logical move to London where, with his wife and infant child, he rented a house in an artists' enclave in Berners Street, north of Oxford Street. As mementos and statements of intent, he took some heirlooms with him. According to family tradition, these included silverware, engraved with the Doyle crest and motto "Patientia Vincit" (he conquers through patience); a pestle and mortar; and a portrait, supposedly by van Dyck, of Thomas Wentworth, First Earl of Strafford. This was an odd choice since Strafford, in the early seventeenth century, had been a leading perpetrator of the despoliation of the Catholic landed gentry, which had cost the Doyles their estates. While suggesting that John bore few grudges, it also pointed to the type of commission he hoped to obtain from high-born patrons.</p><p>Initially business was slow, and John was forced to move several times with his growing family, spending two years south of the river Thames in Lambeth. A change of artistic direction came after he visited the House of Commons. He found that his combination of wit and draftsmanship was well suited to producing caricatures of the participants in the mother of Parliaments. Making good use of modern techniques of lithography, he began in 1827 to publish a regular series of political sketches, which he signed with the initials HB, a composite representation of his initials. With obsessive secrecy, he managed for sixteen years to keep his identity secret. During that period his sarcastic, well observed and usually benevolent cartoons of Britain's political elite provided a graphic bridge between the angry Regency satires of Gillray and Cruikshank and the more respectful High Victorian output of Leech and Tenniel.</p><p>John was soon earning a comfortable living, enough to move in 1833 to a large, new house at 17 Cambridge Terrace (now Sussex Gardens), north of Hyde Park. By then Marianna had produced seven children, all of whom showed varying degrees of artistic talent. His daughter Annette was a gifted musician, and a pious one, who later became a nun. James, born in 1822, was a scholarly youth, whose adoption of his father's more severe traits earned him the nickname "the Priest." Fascinated by the past, he would make a name illustrating and writing about history. Richard, or Dicky, born in 1824, was the most naturally gifted, and would follow "HB" in a successful career, principally as an illustrator. Henry, born in 1827, was also a promising cartoonist, before later finding his m�tier as an arts curator. Then there were Francis and Adelaide, who both died young without making a mark, and, finally, on March 25, 1832, came Arthur's father, Charles Altamont, his second name a nod to HB's early patron, the Marquess of Sligo, who held the subsidiary title Earl of Altamont.</p><p>The atmosphere at Cambridge Terrace was politically and culturally conservative, as might be expected from an Irish Roman Catholic family making its way in late Georgian society. The children were taught at home, since John was skeptical about English education. As was evident from his choice of the French Chapel off Baker Street as his place of worship, he was Francophile in matters of mind and spirit -- a throwback perhaps to his wife's French origins. His son Henry spent a short period at a Jesuit school in the Marylebone Road but, otherwise, the Doyle boys and girls grew up with their own private tutor, Mr. Street, whose services were supplemented by both a fencing and a dancing master. As part of this privileged upbringing, they were expected to devise their own entertainments, centered around a play or a concert every Sunday. With an artist as father, they were also encouraged to go out and observe the world.

He was personally responsible for transporting over two million Jews to their deaths in Auschwitz-Birkenau and other death camps. This is the first account of Eichmann&#39;s life to appear since the aftermath of his famous trial in 1961 and his subsequent execution in Jerusalem a year later. It reveals that the depiction of Eichmann as a loser who drifted into the ranks of the SS is a fabrication that conceals Eichmann&#39;s considerable abilities and his early political development. Drawing on recently unearthed documents, David Cesarani shows how Eichmann became the Reich&#39;s &#34;expert&#34; on Jewish matters and reveals his initially cordial working relationship with Zionist Jews in Germany, despite his intense anti-Semitism. Cesarani explains how the massive ethnic cleansing Eichmann conducted in Poland in 1939-40 was the crucial bridge to his later role in the mass deportation of the Jews. And Cesarani argues controversially that Eichmann was not necessarily predisposed to mass murder, exploring the remarkable, largely unknown period in Eichmann&#39;s early career when he first learned how to become an administrator of genocide. This challenging work deepens our understanding of Adolf Eichmann and offers fresh insights both into the operation of the Final Solution and the making of its most notorious perpetrator.</p><p>The first biography of Eichmann in 40-odd years tells the story of the architect of the Final Solution, incorporating the latest scholarship on the origins and implementation of the Nazi genocide.<b>David Cesarini</b>, one of Britain's leading historians, is Research Professor in History at Royal Holloway, London University.

Moral warrior and nonviolent apostle; man of God rocked by fury, fear, and guilt; rational thinker driven by emotional and spiritual truth -- Martin Luther King Jr. struggled to reconcile these divisions in his soul. Here is an intimate narrative of his intellectual and spiritual journey from cautious liberal, to reluctant radical, to righteous revolutionary. Stewart Burns draws not only on King's speeches, letters, writings, and well-reported strategizing and activities, but also on previously underutilized oral histories of key meetings and events, which present a dramatic account of King and the movement in the crucial years from 1955 to 1968.</p><p>In a striking departure from earlier books on Martin Luther King Jr. and the civil rights movement, Burns focuses on King's biblical faith and spiritual vision as fundamental to his political leadership and shows how these threads wove together a "single garment of destiny," making King the most important social prophet of the twentieth century. King is not portrayed as a lone exalted hero, butas the heart of a fabric of principled leadershipthat stretched from his closest colleagues to the movement's foot soldiers on the streets. This book stresses his shaping by other leaders -- heroic figures such as Bayard Rustin, Ella Baker, James Bevel, Bob Moses, and Marian Wright Edelman -- and his conflicted relationships with John and Robert Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson.</p><p><em>To the Mountaintop</em> is uniquely powerful in presenting actual conversations between King and others, and in showing how King's public words often revealed his private torment. Burns provides a uniquely realist portrait of King and the civil rights movement by revealing the vital but neglected religious character of the story, and by demonstrating how King profoundly experienced the movement as a sacred mission following a path of liberation and sacrifice pioneered by Moses and Jesus.</p></p><p><p>Stewart Burns edited the third volume of the <em>King Papers, Birth of a New Age</em>, and has written the only published history of the Montgomery bus boycott, <em>Daybreak of Freedom</em>. He was a consultant on the award-winning HBO dramatic film <em>Boycott</em>, based on his book. Previously at Stanford University, he now teaches at College of the Redwoods in northern California.</p>Drawing on oral histories, documents and major world events, this intimate new biography chronicles the civil rights leader's struggles with faith and leadership from his days as a novice minister until his assassination in 1968. Burns, the former editor of the King Papers Project at Stanford, asserts that King often saw himself as an unworthy Moses and increasingly drew upon his biblical faith to shape his role in the nonviolence movement. Burns also examines the influence of notable figures on King's life, from Bayard Rustin and Malcolm X to Gandhi and Robert F. Kennedy. Without ever resorting to deification or criticism, he quotes from King's public conversations and speeches, then presents the man's private doubts on everything from LBJ's war against poverty to the Nation of Islam movement, many of which are culled from interviews with Coretta Scott King, Rustin and other trusted advisers. Pivotal events like the Montgomery bus boycott, the Vietnam War and the March on Washington are brought alive through narratives that show their impact on King's path of righteousness. Burns's` ear for dialogue and attention to details-the shiny green Chevy King's parents bought him upon graduation from divinity school, the arduous shaving process often blamed for his tardiness-help keep the book from spiraling into dry textbook formula. It's a thought-provoking examination of the inner struggles of a widely covered public figure, and its thorough research and insights should help it stand out among the slew of other King biographies on the shelves. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Sprawling across 2200 miles, this shadow side of Los Angeles is in the high Mojave Desert. Known as the Antelope Valley, it's a terrain of savage dignity, a vast amphitheatre of startling wonders that put on a show as the megalopolis burrows northward into the region's last frontier. Ranchers, cowboys, dreamers, dropouts, bikers, hikers, and felons have settled here - those who have chosen solitude over the trappings of contemporary life or simply have nowhere else to go. But in recent years their lives have been encroached upon by the creeping spread of subdivisions, funded by the once easy money of subprime America. McMansions - many empty now - gradually replaced Joshua trees; the desert - America's escape hatch - began to vanish as it became home to a latter-day exodus of pilgrims.<p>It is against the backdrop of these two competing visions of land and space that Donald Kueck - a desert hermit who loved animals and hated civilization - took his last stand, gunning down beloved deputy sheriff Steven Sorensen when he approached his trailer at high noon on a scorching summer day. As the sound of rifle fire echoed across the Mojave, Kueck took off into the desert he knew so well, kicking off the biggest manhunt in modern California history until he was finally killed in a Wagnerian firestorm under a full moon as nuns at a nearby convent watched and prayed.</p><p>This manhunt was the subject of a widely praised article by Deanne Stillman, first published in <i>Rolling Stone</i>, a finalist for a PEN Center USA journalism award, and included in the anthology Best American Crime Writing 2006. In <i>Desert Reckoning</i> she continues her desert beat and uses Kueck's story as a point of departure to further explore our relationship to place and the wars that are playing out on our homeland. In addition, Stillman also delves into the hidden history of Los Angeles County, and traces the paths of two men on a collision course that could only end in the modern Wild West. Why did a brilliant, self-taught rocket scientist who just wanted to be left alone go off the rails when a cop showed up? What role did the California prison system play in this drama? What happens to people when the American dream is stripped away? And what is it like for the men who are sworn to protect and serve?</p></p><p><p><b>Deanne Stillman</b> is a widely published, critically acclaimed writer. &nbsp;Her books include <i>Mustang: The Saga of the Wild Horse in the American West</i>, a <i>Los Angeles Times </i>"Best Book 2008," and winner of the California Book Award silver medal for nonfiction, and <i>Twentynine Palms: A True Story of Murder, Marines, and the Mojave</i>, a <i>Los Angeles Times </i>"Best Book 2001" which Hunter Thompson called "A strange and brilliant story by an important American writer." &nbsp;Now a cult classic, it's out in a new, updated edition with a foreword by T.

This tragedy, which was first deemed to be an &#x201c;accident,&#x201d; was actually, as James Raffan explains, a shocking tale of a school&#x2019;s survival philosophy gone terribly wrong, unsafe canoes and equipment, and a total lack of emergency preparedness training. <em>Deep Waters</em> is a remarkable story of endurance, courage and unspeakable pain, a book that also explores the nature of risk-taking and the resilience of the human spirit.</p></p><p><p>James Raffan is one of our foremost authorities on the North, the wilderness and the canoeing tradition. He is the author of <em>Fire in the Bones</em>, the acclaimed bestselling biography of Bill Mason; <em>Bark, Skin and Cedar: Exploring the Canoe in Canadian Experience</em>; and <em>Deep Waters</em>. He is also the editor of <em>Rendezvous with the Wild: The Boreal Forest</em> and <em>The Lure of Faraway Places</em>. Raffan is a fellow and former governor of the Royal Canadian Geographical Society, and has served as chair of the Arctic Institute of North America. A recipient of the Queen's Golden Jubilee Medal, he is the curator of the Canadian Canoe Museum in Peterborough.

Many readers will be shocked by Canada's deep connection to the war--Canadians fought in every major battle, supplied arms to the South, and many key Confederate meetings took place on Canadian soil. Boyko gives Americans a new understanding of the North American context of the war, and also shows how the political climate of the time created a more unified Canada, one that was able to successfully oppose American expansion.<br>&nbsp;<br>Filled with engaging stories and astonishing facts from previously unaccessed primary sources, Boyko's fascinating new interpretation of the war will appeal to all readers of history. <i>Blood and Daring </i>will change our views not just of Canada's relationship with the United States, but of Confederation itself.</p></p><p><p>John Boyko is the author of 4 previous books, including the critically acclaimed <i>Bennett: The Rebel Who Challenged and Changed a Nation </i>and <i>Last Steps to Freedom: The Evolution of Canadian Racism</i>. He is a teacher and administrator at Lakefield College School, and an op-ed contributor to newspapers across Canada.</p><p>NATIONAL BESTSELLER <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;A wonderful and seamless popular history full of colourful characters, intrigue and political backstabbing of the first order.

The authoritative narration is clear, precise, and entirely enjoyable for non-scholars. The book presents a startlingly unfamiliar and ominously dangerous period in Canadian-American relations.... It&#x2019;s the birth of Canada in all its glory and muck.&#x201d; <br>&#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i> (starred review) <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Boyko has spun a compelling narrative. Better still, it&#x2019;s supported by just the right measure of academic rigour.&#x201d; <br>&#x2014;<i>Winnipeg Free Press</i> <br><br>&#x201c;In the middle of the nineteenth century, Canada was at a risk never matched before or since. After threatening invasion during the Civil War, the United States looked northwards after it was won to fulfill its Manifest Destiny. Historian John Boyko tells this story in <i>Blood and Daring.</i> He does so by recounting the stories of six &#x2018;guides.&#x2019; Some are famous like Sir John A. Macdonald, and his principal opponent William Seward, Secretary of State and an ardent annexationist. Others are little known, such as escaped slave John Anderson who used Canadian law to avoid expatriation, and Sarah Edmonds, one of forty thousand Canadians to join the fight with the North or South. With verve and passion and impeccable research, Boyko makes this vital story come alive.&#x201d; <br>&#x2014;Richard Gwyn, award-winning author of <i>John A.</i> and <i>Nation Maker</i><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;The American Civil War involved more of the North American continent than the Union and the Confederacy.&nbsp;Forty thousand Canadians fought in Union armies, Confederate agents operated in Canadian provinces, and the Canadian-American border was the scene of skirmishes that threatened to escalate into a larger conflict.&nbsp;In this lively and eye-opening book, John Boyko shows how the war and its aftermath not only gave the United States a new birth of freedom; it also gave birth to the new nation of Canada.&#x201d; <br>&#x2014;James M.

She has been in private practice in New York since 1972.A sober study by a clinical psychologist of the destructive legacy that narcissistic parents bequeath to their children and the troubling characteristics those children share as adults. Narcissists behave, Golomb says, as if they are the center of the universe, organizing their lives around denial of negative feelings about themselves. Their children, forced to conform to parental thinking, grow up with a range of subtle emotional disabilities, most commonly a distorted view of their capacities. All too frequently this damaged sense of self-worth interferes with their search for autonomy, their performance, and with their other adult relationships. Golomb, child of a narcissistic father, gives examples from the lives of friends and patients, as well as from her own experiences, and shows how these strained views of reality can be passed along from one generation to the next or can shadow an entire family's happiness. She is particularly adept in discussing why some people persist in the most puzzling behaviors (bankrolling one lover after another, for example) and how they see and defend these patterns. Although Golomb has experimented with meditation techniques and group treatment, she finds psychoanalytic psychotherapy the most consistently helpful set of strategies and suggests ways for adults to approach narcissistic parents and to change the nature of these relationships. ``Narcissism is a tale of codependency,'' she observes. ``If we want to be treated in a different way, the change in treatment must start with how we present ourselves to [narcissists].'' Golomb writes in language more accessible to other therapists than to general readers, unleavened by humor, and without a specific agenda. But difficult as her approach may be, it's sound and ultimately rewarding as well. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

In this highly prescient book, originally published in 1997, he provides a powerful analysis of the new unilateral capitalist era following the collapse of the Soviet model, and the apparent triumph of the market and globalization.<br><br>Amin's innovative analysis charts the rise of ethnicity and fundamentalism as consequences of the failure of ruling classes in the South to counter the exploitative terms of globalization. This has had profound implications and continues to resonate today. Furthermore, his deconstruction of the Bretton Woods institutions as managerial mechanisms which protect the profitability of capital provides an important insight into the continued difficulties in reforming them. Amin's rejection of the apparent inevitability of globalization in its present polarising form is particularly prophetic - instead he asserts the need for each society to negotiate the terms of its inter-dependence with the rest of the global economy.<br><br>A landmark work by a key contemporary thinker.</p><p><b>Samir Amin</b> is director of the Third World Forum, based in Senegal, and Chair of the World Forum for Alternatives. His numerous books include <i>The People's Spring: the Future of the Arab Revolutions</i>, <i>The Liberal Virus: Permanent War and the Americanization of the World</i>, <i>Accumulation on a World Scale</i> and <i>Unequal Development</i>.&#39;The analyses of Samir Amin, based on wide-ranging historical knowledge combined with intelligent use of theory, give us the solid anchors we need to understand current realities. They are often provocative and always prudent, which is why they are mandatory reading.&#39; Immanuel Wallerstein, Yale University &#39;Samir Amin&#39;s writings are informed by depth of political economy and breadth of history. Grounded in the analytical tools of historical materialism and guided by the political perspective of the working people, he is unwavering in his commitment to a better and more humane social order. In Capitalism in the Age of Globalization, Amin shows that there is indeed an alternative to the plunder and pillage of the last five centuries of capitalism and war mongering imperialism.

Raised in Hannibal, Missouri, Twain held a variety of jobs including typesetter, riverboat pilot, and miner before achieving nationwide attention for his work as a journalist with The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County. He earned critical and popular praise for his wit and enjoyed a successful career as a public speaker in addition to his writing. Twain s works were remarkable for his ability to capture colloquial speech, although his adherence to the vernacular of the time has resulted in the suppression of his works by schools in modern times.

There he had to learn the secrets of the wild to survive&#x2014;how to talk with animals, swing through the trees, and fight against the great predators. He grew to the strength and courage of his fellow apes. And in time, his human intelligence promised him the kingship of the tribe. He became truly Lord of the Jungle.<br><br>Then men entered his jungle, bringing with them the wanton savagery of civilized greed and lust&#x2014;and bringing also the first white woman Tarzan has ever seen. Now suddenly, Tarzan had to choose between two worlds. . . .</p><p>First published in 1914, Edgar Rice Burroughs's romance has lost little of its force over the years--as film revivals and TV series well attest. <i>Tarzan of the Apes</i> is very much a product of its age: replete with bloodthirsty natives and a bulky, swooning American Negress, and haunted by what zoo specialists now call charismatic megafauna (great beasts snarling, roaring, and stalking, most of whom would be out of place in a real African jungle). Burroughs countervails such incorrectness, however, with some rather unattractive representations of white civilization--mutinous, murderous sailors, effete aristos, self-involved academics, and hard-hearted cowards. At Tarzan's heart rightly lies the resourceful and hunky title character, a man increasingly torn between the civil and the savage, for whom cutlery will never be less than a nightmare. <p> The passages in which the nut-brown boy teaches himself to read and write are masterly and among the book's improbable, imaginative best. How tempting it is to adopt the ten-year-old's term for letters--"little bugs"! And the older Tarzan's realization that civilized "men were indeed more foolish and more cruel than the beasts of the jungle," while not exactly a new notion, is nonetheless potent. The first in Burroughs's serial is most enjoyable in its resounding oddities of word and thought, including the unforgettable "When Tarzan killed he more often smiled than scowled; and smiles are the foundation of beauty."</p>The first time I ever went to Tarzana, California, I walked down Ventura Boulevard, noticing that all of the buildings were really ugly. Then I arrive at my destination: a small house, set back from the street, with a beautiful tree shading the entire front yard. Inside, the air was cool and everything was polished wood, especially the incredible, gigantic desk. That's where he worked. It was awesome.<br><br>Edgar Rice Burroughs had a huge California ranch, and the land eventually became a town, named for Burroughs's most famous character. Burroughs created one of the few heroes everyone knows, and at that desk, he took Tarzan to exotic lands, had him face bizarre creatures and endless, exotic challenges. Those adventures spirit the reader away to a timeless time of action and heroism. And sitting in that office, I was a permanent convert. For me, and for countless others, the legend will never cease. And that's as it should be.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--Steve Saffel, Senior Editor</p><h2>American Photographers and The National Parks (A Studio book)</h2><p>New book, hardcover in slipcase.

Slavery is legal once again. the few Jews who still survive hide under assumed names. In San Francisco the I Ching is as common as the Yellow Pages. All because some 20 years earlier the United States lost a war--and is now occupied jointly by Nazi Germany and Japan. This harrowing, Hugo Award-winning novel is the work that established Philip K.

In it Dick offers a haunting vision of history as a nightmare from which it may just be possible to awake. About the Author Philip K Dick was born in Chicago in 1928, but lived most of his life in California. He began reading science fiction when he was 12 and was never able to stop.

"Mirrorings," from Harper's magazine, describes her childhood cancer and disfigurement, the subject of her critically acclaimed Autobiography of a Face (selected as one of LJ's Best Books of 1994). In another essay, she is shocked to find herself face to face on a talk show with a fan who had been stalking her and whom she was supposed to surprise. Other pieces deal with the rootlessness of immigrants (her family came from Ireland and England), the physical nature of love for animals and the competition for a dog's attention at a friend's house, and her lack of closeness with her twin sister. The author struggles with tango lessons, and she falls in love with the boots on a model in an advertisement in spite of their impracticality. Although she's sometimes guilty of "interrupting myself and going off on tangents and including extraneous information," her observations are fresh and laced with humor.

An important precursor to the Expressionists, Friedrich once wrote that an artist must &#34;close your bodily eye so that you may see your picture first with the spiritual eye.

The novel does include some continuing characters from the Trilogy, along with new characters, which are some of the best in the Sienkiewicz canon. But the promise of a new trilogy was not to be. Sienkiewicz died in 1916. Fortunately, <i>On the Field of Glory</i> is a great read in its own right and represents at least one major point of interest for readers of Sienkiewicz's historical fiction: the memorable character of Anulka Sieninska is more fully rendered than any leading ladies of the original trilogy. This translation by Miroslaw Lipinski is a skillful blend of modern English with a touch of suitable antiquity so effective in the original language of Sienkiewicz. The epilogue by the translator provides useful commentary and additional background for a most glorious, in brief, period of Polish history. </p><p> HENRYK SIENKIEWICZ was born in Poland in 1846.

For here, with the&nbsp;gemlike beauty and hardness that poetry alone can achieve, are his ideas about the nature of things that lay behind his writings."--<i>Christianity Today</i> &nbsp; Although C.S. Lewis never published a book of verse during his lifetime, he wrote poetry from the age of fourteen. This poetic impulse is evident in much of Lewis's work, including his first prose piece, <i>The Pilgrim's Regress</i>, which contains a number of short lyrics, and his novel <i>Till We Have Faces</i>, which had its beginnings as a long poem. There is a great variety of subjects in these poems--God and the pagan deities, unicorns, spaceships, nature, love, age, and reason. Walter Hooper, the editor of this collection, points out that the same man is revealed in his poetry as in his prose: "His wonderful imagination is the guiding thread." &nbsp; "Take[s] an important place in the Lewis canon."--<i>The New York Times Book Review</i> &nbsp; C. S. Lewis (1898-1963) gained international renown for an impressive array of beloved works both popular and scholarly: literary criticism, children's literature, fantasy literature, and numerous books on theology. Among his most celebrated achievements are <i>Out of the Silent Planet, The Chronicles of Narnia, The Screwtape Letters, The Four Loves, </i>and <i>Surprised by Joy</i>.<br>Clive Staples Lewis (1898-1963) was one of the intellectual giants of the twentieth century and arguably one of the most influential writers of his day. He was a fellow and tutor in English Literature at Oxford University until 1954 when he was unanimously elected to the Chair of Medieval and Renaissance English at Cambridge University, a position he held until his retirement. Walter Hooper was born in Reidsville, North Carolina. He first met C.S Lewis in 1963 and following Lewis&#39;s death he assisted Owen Barfield in managing Lewis&#39;s literary estate. Now a trustee of the Lewis estate. Hooper is regarded as one of the world&#39;s leading authorities on the life and works of C.S. Lewis. He has edited and written introductions for dozens of Lewis&#39;s religious books.

The six hundred men, women and children who live there&#x2015;almost all of them Athabascan Gwich'in Natives&#x2015;have little to cheer for. Their traditional Indian ways of life are rapidly vanishing in the face of a modern culture that is closing in on all sides, threatening to destroy their community and their identity. The one source of pride they can count on is their boys' high school basketball team&#x2015;the Fort Yukon Eagles.</p><p><i>Eagle Blue </i>follows the Eagles, winners of six regional championships in a row, through the course of an entire 28-game season, from their first day of practice in late November to the Alaska State Championship Tournament in March. With insight, frankness, and compassion, Michael D'Orso climbs into the lives of these fourteen boys, their families, and their coach, shadowing them through an Arctic winter of fifty-below-zero temperatures and near-round-the-clock darkness as the Eagles criss-cross Alaska by air, van, and snow machine in pursuit of their&#x2015;and their village's&#x2015;dream.</p></p><p><p><b>Michael D'Orso</b> is the author of more than a dozen books, including <i>Plundering Paradise</i>, <i>Like Judgment Day, Like No Other Time</i> (with Tom Daschle), and <i>Walking with the Wind</i> (with John Lewis).</p>You can't help losing your heart to the Gwich'in kids of Eagle Blue, Michael D'Orso's captivating literary documentary of the 2004 Fort Yukon High School basketball season. The Gwich'in are Indians, not Eskimos or Inuit; though nowadays many of them are children or grandchildren of interracial marriages, they are related to the Navajo and the Apache. Their town lies just inside the Arctic Circle, 150 miles northeast of Fairbanks, Alaska, and in 2004 their high school had an enrollment of 32. Fort Yukon is not free of the alcoholism, cultural confusion and defeatism that poison so much of Native American life. "That's one thing that really sucks about life here, [a student named Matt Shewfelt] will tell you straight up. Whenever someone tries to do something worthwhile, to make something of themselves -- and this is true of the grownups as well as the kids -- it seems like everyone else tries to pull them back down." <p>But the town has a tradition of good basketball, thanks in no small part to coach Dave Bridges, who has repeatedly taken his boys to Anchorage for the state tournament in their small-school division. The 2004 crop showed exceptional promise. They weren't tall -- only two players were a bit over six feet -- but they were fast, with some standout shooters, especially from beyond the three-point line. They had bench strength, and, at Bridges's insistence, they were in terrific shape. (Before the season was over, they came from behind to win more than once, their stamina helping them overtake wobbling opponents.)</p><p>D'Orso is such a spirited writer that he could surely make the reader empathize with boys from any of the teams Fort Yukon played over the season, including the one from a town of Russian Old Believers where the people still wear Amish-like garb. But he persuades us that there was something special about these Eagles, a blend of selflessness and maturity that kicked in when the boys took the court. Many of them came from broken homes, or had grown up seeing their once-athletic fathers go to seed, or had themselves already gotten into trouble. The boys might claim that they shot hoops to attract babes, but for virtually all of them, basketball -- with its excitement, its wholesome relief from domestic anxieties, its opportunity for travel outside of bush Alaska -- was the most enriching part of life. Previous teams had come so close to winning state so often that a current of hope seemed to ripple through the cold Fort Yukon air: This might just be the year.</p><p>D'Orso ably sketches the mentality of rural interior Alaska: a combination of fascination with the urban world (the sweetest kid on the team affected gangsta outfits and lingo) and disdain for city slickers who think they can just waltz into the backcountry. For example, the players couldn't figure out the fuss over Chris McCandless. He, you may recall, was the young man who in 1992 hitchhiked to Denali National Park, intending to live off the land despite his utter unpreparedness. After he was found dead of starvation, two books were written about him. According to D'Orso, the boys on the team considered McCandless "an idiot -- the same kind of idiot who's been coming up to Alaska forever, all the way back to the gold-rush days. . . . What galls the hell out of the people who live here . . . is the lack of respect shown by these backpackers and hippies and seekers-of-truth who have no idea what they're in for in roadless Alaska and don't take the time or the trouble to find out." </p><p>D'Orso also has a gift for bringing ball games to life. He dwells on the Eagles' attempts to implement their coach's perennial strategy, which is to force the other team to play Fort Yukon's game, not the one they've grown comfortable with. And D'Orso brings to life the "run," in which a combination of steals, fouls by the other team and a three-pointer or two can propel a team from a few points back to a few points ahead in a matter of seconds. Reading Eagle Blue has the same nerve-wracking effect as watching a real-life game in which someone you know and love is playing.</p><p>You can flip to the back of the book and find out how the Eagles' 2004 season turned out, but I wouldn't advise it. Better to take each game as it comes, living the season much as did the boys themselves in D'Orso's sensitive, exhilarating account. </p><p>Reviewed by Dennis Drabelle <br>Copyright 2006, The Washington Post.

His emphasis on the eternal hope of the believer lies behind his call to radical Christian living. </p> <p>This popular edition combines two earlier editions translated and edited by John Nichols Lenker, with supplementary notes by George Roerer and chapter outlines by J. G. Walsh. </p> <p><strong>Martin Luther</strong> (1483&#x2013;1546) left his comfortable upbringing to become a Roman Catholic monk and later a professor of theology at the University of Wittenberg in Saxony. His study and teaching of the Greek text of the New Testament represent the beginnings of modern textual study, and his widely disseminated writings sparked the Protestant Reformation in Europe. Other works by Luther include <em>Commentary on Romans</em> and<em> Commentary on Galatians.</em></p>Martin Luther (1483&#x2013;1546) was born in Germany and is famous for his protest, The Ninety-five Theses, which he nailed to the door of the castle church of Wittenberg. The son of middle-class parents, Luther left his comfortable life to become a monk. Luther&#x2019;s own spiritual awakening was sparked by his study of the Greek text of Paul&#x2019;s letter to the Romans, which challenged him with the statement, &#x201c;The just shall live by faith.&#x201d;</p><h2>Charity in Truth: Caritas in Veritate</h2><p>Benedict XVI has something for everyone in&nbsp;<i>Charity in Truth</i>&#x2014;from praising profit to defending the environment, from calling for a role for government in the economy to insisting on the necessity of moral transformation and "gratuitousness" in economic life, from the issue of immigration to the importance of technology. However, he also insists on discernment and the purification of our ideas by faith and reason, in order to temper any immoderate and one-sided enthusiasms. <p><i>Charity and Truth</i>&nbsp;was expected to be&#x2014;and is&#x2014;the Pope's encyclical on "social justice." And indeed "justice" and "rights" find their proper place. But "charity" and truth are shown to be the fundamental principles. Charity is at the heart of the Church's social doctrine, he writes. "Without truth, without trust and love for what is true, there is no social conscience and responsibility, and social action ends up serving private interests and the logic of power".</p><p>Benedict calls for "integral human development," which promotes "the good of every man and of the whole man", including the spiritual dimension, "the perspective of eternal life". Without this, "human progress in this world is denied breathing-space."</p><p>What's more, true development requires "openness to life". ""If there is lack of respect for the right to life and a natural death," he writes, "if human conception, gestation and birth are made artificial, if human embryos are sacrificed to research, the conscience of society ends up losing the concept of human ecology and, along with it, that of environmental ecology. It is contradictory to insist that future generations respect the natural environment when our educational system and laws do not help them to respect themselves."</p><p>With respect to economics, the Pope insists every economic decision has a moral consequence. He avoids the extremes of an unbridled capitalism and socialism. Instead, he holds that "the logic of the market and the logic of the State"&#x2014;free economic exchange with political oversight and restraint&#x2014;are not enough to secure human flourishing. There must be a generosity and gratuitousness among citizens and nations that goes beyond economic and political systems. "Charity" is necessary for "justice" to be "justice".</p><p>Benedict also argues that technology must not be seen as automatically providing solutions to problems, without the need for morality. Nor must man seek to avoid responsibility for overcoming social problems by rejecting technological development as inevitably evil. Benedict insists that man must be humble yet confident that he can, through faith and reason, make true progress in human development.</p></p><p><p><b>Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI </b>(Joseph Ratzinger) is widely recognized as one of the most brilliant theologians and spiritual leaders of our age.

He was a prolific writer whose other works include fantasy and science fiction stories, plays, romances, poetry, non-fiction and historical novels. <br> <br> Supported by wealthy uncles, Doyle was sent to the Jesuit preparatory school Hodder Place, Stonyhurst, at the age of nine (1868&#x2013;70).

His first work featuring Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, <i>A Study in Scarlet</i>, was taken by Ward Lock &amp; Co on 20 November 1886, giving Doyle �25 (�2500 today) for all rights to the story.

Like a skip in the acetate, his murder and the scandal that grew from it have been the repeated focus of attention, to the exclusion of nearly everything else. Over time, the line between fact and fiction blurred, and his life story became distorted. All perspective on Bob Crane as a human being was lost, and he became nothing more than a two-dimensional cartoon character without depth, understanding, or definition. Now, nearly two hundred people who knew the <i>Hogan's Heroes </i>star personally and better than most (family; friends as far back as elementary school; colleagues in radio, television, theatre, and film) have spoken out on Bob Crane's behalf, and in many instances, for the first time. Within the pages of this book, they share their memories and thoughts about a man whom they knew as an exceptional and talented musician, a genius in radio, a sharp-witted comedian, a gifted actor and director, a man driven to success, a doting and loving father, a loyal friend, and a kind and gentle spirit with a sunny personality, a man who, while not perfect, was vastly different from how he has been presented over the decades.Bob Crane: The Definitive Biography balances the scales and sets the record straight, providing a full and complete history of Bob Crane, clarifying who he really was, and just as importantly, who he was not.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br><i><b>Deluxe, expanded hardcover edition contains:</b></i><br><ul><li>Exclusive, never-before released historical documents chronicling Bob Crane's life and career.</li><li>More than 200 family and professional photographs, many exclusive, courtesy of&nbsp;Bob Crane's family, friends, and colleagues.</li><li>660 pages&nbsp;containing first-hand accounts from nearly 200 people from Bob Crane's life.</li><li>A pre-print of&nbsp;Bob Crane's original signature.</li></ul><b>All editions contain the same editorial content.

It has been nearly a life-long journey. I first discovered <i>Hogan's Heroes</i> in the mid-1980s when I was just fourteen years old. <i>Hogan's Heroes</i> quickly became my favorite television show, and Bob Crane was my favorite among the cast. There was no Internet in 1985, so I didn't discover any details about the life and death of the show's star right away. But soon, I did learn about Bob's unsolved murder, and I was crushed. And my little, fourteen-year-old self made a promise that somehow, some way, I would fix it and make it better. As a kid, I had no idea how I was ever going to do that. But that didn't&nbsp;stop me.<br>&nbsp;<br>This inexplicable determination to "fix it" grew. On weekends, other kids went to the movies or to the mall; my parents took me to the county library to "research" Bob Crane. Over the years, I started to&nbsp;understand who Bob Crane really was, and the more I understood,the more tenacious I became. When Linda Groundwater, Dee Young, and I crossed paths and began collaborating on this book in 2006--a project Linda started in 2003--all of the pieces started to come together.<br>&nbsp;<br>It took a little while, but now, more than thirty years later, I have finally made good on that promise. <br>&nbsp;<br>This unbiased work took twelve years to research (officially), across two continents and many time zones. It contains the first-hand accounts from 200 prominent individuals from Bob's life--many of whom I am humbled and honored to now count as a part of my own life. To all of them and to everyone who contributed and/or supported this endeavor, I extend my deepest gratitude and thanks. And to all of you who choose to learn more about the talented, complex, and remarkable man Bob Crane was, I thank you, from the bottom of my heart and on behalf of so many who cared so deeply for him.&nbsp;<br><b>Author proceeds will be donated to various charities (to be determined) in Bob Crane's memory. Thank you for your support!</b><br>&nbsp;<br>--Carol M.

In January 1976, Dee was fortunate to have had the opportunity to meet Bob Crane on the day he was in Bridgeport to help WICC celebrate the station's 50th anniversary. She remembers him and the overall experience of his visit fondly. Dee has been instrumental in the research and development of <i>Bob Crane: The Definitive Biography</i>. She brought a wealth of radio knowledge and history spanning several decades to the book, and her network of radio colleagues, including several key individuals who worked alongside of Bob at WICC and/or knew him well, has allowed for a rich illustration of Bob's early career in broadcasting.<br>&nbsp;<br>Since 2011, Dee has also assisted Carol Ford with Bob Crane's nomination for the National Radio Hall of Fame. WICC is an official sponsor of the nomination.<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Linda J. Groundwater</b><br>Linda J. Groundwater is a former freelance writer and American radio news journalist.

She is currently a Retail Lending Specialist for the Bank of Queensland, Capalaba, and has nearly twenty years of experience in banking management.<br>&nbsp;<br>In 2003, Linda took an interest in learning more about Bob Crane. She believed there had to be more to his story than his starring role on&nbsp;<i>Hogan's Heroes</i>,or his murder and the scandal that grew from it. Using her journalism skills,she began to reach out to people from Bob's life with the intent to gather information to produce a more balanced biography. Early contributors/supporters included Bob's cousin Jim Senich and Reverend Edward Beck, who applauded the effort. From there, the list grew steadily. Dee Young and Carol Ford became involved in the project in 2005 and early 2006, respectively, and together,they amassed a collection of interviews and memories from 200 people from Bob's life specifically for&nbsp;<i>Bob Crane: The Definitive Biography</i>&nbsp;(then with the working title&nbsp;<i>Flipside: The True Story of Bob Crane</i>).<br>&nbsp;<br>Also an actress, Linda performs professionally as well as in local community theatre in the Queensland area. She is also Vice President and Publicity Officer for the Mount Cotton Drama Group. Linda's faith, her family, loyal friends, and her German Shepherd named Midnight are all most important to her. She is especially proud of her son Andrew, who is pursuing his professional acting career in both Australia and the United States.<b>Carol M. Ford</b> has worked in the publishing industry since1997.

Weather like this makes everyone hurry; scurrying past on slippery pavements with chins buried into collars. Passing cars send spray over their shoes; the noise from the traffic making it impossible for her to hear more than a few words of the chattering update that began the moment the school gates opened. The words burst from him without a break, mixed up and back to front in the excitement of this new world into which he is growing. She makes out something about a best friend; a project on space; a new teacher, and she looks down and smiles at his excitement, ignoring the cold that weaves its way through her scarf. The boy grins back and tips up his head to taste the rain; wet eyelashes forming dark clumps around his eyes.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;And I can write my name, Mummy!&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;You clever boy,&#x201d; she says, stopping to kiss him fiercely on his damp forehead. &#x201c;Will you show me when you get home?&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>They walk as quickly as five-year-old legs will allow, her free hand holding his bag, which bangs against her knees.</i></p><p><i>Nearly home.</i></p><p><i>Headlights glint on wet tarmac, the dazzle blinding them every few seconds. Waiting for a break in the traffic they duck across the busy road, and she tightens her grip on the small hand inside the soft woolen glove, so he has to run to keep up. Sodden leaves cling to the railings, their bright colors darkening to a dull brown.</i></p><p><i>They reach the quiet street where home lies just around the corner, its seductive warmth a welcome thought. Secure in the environs of her own neighborhood she lets go of his hand to push away the strands of wet hair from her eyes, laughing at the cascade of droplets it causes.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;There,&#x201d; she says, as they make the final turn. &#x201c;I left the light on for us.&#x201d; Across the street, a redbrick house. Two bedrooms, the tiniest kitchen,</i></p><p><i>and a garden crammed with pots she always means to fill with flowers. Just the two of them.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll race you, Mummy . . .&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>He never stops moving; full of energy from the second he wakes until the moment his head hits the pillow.

Milk; biscuit; twenty minutes of television; fish-fingers for tea. The routine they have fallen into so quickly, barely halfway through that first term at school.</i></p><p><i>The car comes from nowhere. The squeal of wet brakes, the thud of a five- year-old boy hitting the windshield and the spin of his body before it slams onto the road. Running after him, in front of the still-moving car. Slipping and falling heavily onto outstretched hands, the impact taking her breath away.</i></p><p><i>It&#x2019;s over in a heartbeat.</i></p><p><i>She crouches beside him, searching frantically for a pulse. Watches her breath form a solitary white cloud in the air. Sees the dark shadow form beneath his head and hears her own wail as though it comes from someone else.

And as she kisses him and begs him to wake, the pool of yellow light that envelops them shrinks to a narrow beam; the car backs up the street. Engine whining in admonishment, the car makes two, three, four attempts to turn in the narrow street, scraping in its haste against one of the huge sycamore sentries lining the road.</i></p><p><i>And then it is dark.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>PART ONE</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1</p><p>Detective Inspector Ray Stevens stood next to the window and contemplated his office chair, on which an arm had been broken for at least a year. Until now he had simply taken the pragmatic approach of not leaning on the left side, but while he was at lunch someone had scrawled &#x201c;Defective&#x201d; in black marker pen across the back of it. Ray wondered if Business Support&#x2019;s newfound enthusiasm for equipment audits would extend to a replacement, or whether he was destined to run Bristol CID from a chair that cast serious doubts over his credibility.</p><p>Leaning forward to find a marker pen in his chaotic top drawer, Ray crouched down and changed the label to &#x201c;Detective.&#x201d; The door to his office opened and he hastily stood up, replacing the lid on the pen.</p><p>&#x201c;Ah, Kate, I was just . . .&#x201d; He stopped, recognizing the look on her face almost before he saw the Command and Control printout in her hand. &#x201c;What have you got?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A hit-and-run in Fishponds, guv. Five-year-old boy killed.&#x201d;</p><p>Ray stretched out a hand for the piece of paper and scanned it while Kate stood awkwardly in the doorway. Fresh from shift, she had only been on CID for a couple of months and was still finding her feet. She was good though: better than she knew.</p><p>&#x201c;No registration number?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not as far as we know. Shift have got the scene contained and the skipper&#x2019;s taking a statement from the child&#x2019;s mother as we speak. She&#x2019;s badly in shock, as you can imagine.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Are you all right to stay late?&#x201d; Ray asked, but Kate was nodding before he&#x2019;d even finished the question. They exchanged half-smiles in mutual acknowledgement of the adrenaline rush it always felt so wrong to enjoy when something so horrific had happened.</p><p>&#x201c;Right then, let&#x2019;s go.&#x201d;</p><p>They nodded a greeting to the throng of smokers clustered under cover by the back door.</p><p>&#x201c;All right, Stumpy?&#x201d; Ray said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m taking Kate out to the Fish- ponds hit-and-run. Can you get on to Area Intelligence and see if any- thing&#x2019;s come in yet?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Will do.&#x201d; The older man took a final drag of his roll-up. Detective Sergeant Jake Owen had been called Stumpy for so much of his career that it was always a surprise to hear his full name read out in court. A man of few words, Stumpy had more war stories than he chose to share, and was without a shadow of a doubt Ray&#x2019;s best DS. The two men had been on shift together for several years, and with a strength that belied his small stature, Stumpy was a handy crewmate to have on your side.</p><p>In addition to Kate, Stumpy&#x2019;s team included the steady Malcolm Johnson and young Dave Hillsdon, an enthusiastic but maverick DC, whose determined efforts to secure convictions sailed a little too close to the wind for Ray&#x2019;s liking. Together they made a good team, and Kate was learning fast from them. She had a fiery passion that made Ray nostalgic for his days as a hungry DC, before seventeen years of bureaucracy had ground him down.</p><p>Kate drove the unmarked Corsa through mounting rush-hour traffic to Fishponds. She was an impatient driver; tutting when a red light held them back, and craning her neck to see past a holdup. She was perpetually in motion: tapping fingers on the steering wheel, screwing up her nose, shifting in her seat. As the traffic started moving again, she leaned forward as though the movement would propel them forward faster.</p><p>&#x201c;Missing blues and twos?&#x201d; Ray said.</p><p>Kate grinned. &#x201c;Maybe a bit.&#x201d; There was eyeliner smudged around her eyes, but otherwise her face was clean of makeup. Dark brown curls fell messily about her face, despite the tortoiseshell clip presumably intended to hold them back.</p><p>Ray fished for his mobile to make the necessary calls, confirming that the Collision Investigation Unit was en route, the duty superintendent had been informed, and that someone had called out the Ops wagon&#x2014;a lumbering vehicle stuffed to the gunnels with tenting, emergency lights, and hot drinks. Everything had been done. In all honesty, he thought, it always had been, but as duty DI the buck stopped with him. There was usually a bit of hackle-rising from shift when CID turned up and started going over old ground, but that was just the way it had to be. They&#x2019;d all been through it; even Ray, who had spent as little time in uniform as possible before moving on.</p><p>He spoke to Control Room to let them know they were five minutes away, but didn&#x2019;t call home. Ray had taken to phoning Mags instead on the rare occasion when he was going to be on time, which seemed a much more practical approach to the long hours the job demanded of him.</p><p>As they rounded the corner Kate slowed the car to a crawl. Half a dozen police cars were strewn haphazardly down the street; lights throwing a blue glow across the scene every other second. Floodlights were mounted on metal tripods, their strong beams picking out the fine mist of rain, which had thankfully abated in the last hour.</p><p>Kate had stopped on their way out of the station to grab a coat and exchange her heels for wellies. &#x201c;Practicality before style,&#x201d; she had laughed, throwing the shoes into her locker and pulling on the boots. Ray rarely gave much thought to either principle, but he wished now he&#x2019;d at least brought a coat.</p><p>They parked the car a hundred meters away from a large white tent, erected in an attempt to protect from the rain whatever evidence might have been left. One side of the tent was open, and inside they could see a crime scene investigator on her hands and knees, swabbing at something unseen. Farther up the road a second paper-suited figure was examining one of the huge trees that lined the road.</p><p>As Ray and Kate drew near to the scene they were stopped by a young PC, his fluorescent jacket zipped so high Ray could barely make out a face between the peak of his hat and his collar.</p><p>&#x201c;Evening, sir. Do you need to come in? I&#x2019;ll have to sign you in.&#x201d; &#x201c;No, thank you,&#x201d; said Ray. &#x201c;Can you tell me where your sergeant is?&#x201d; &#x201c;He&#x2019;s at the mother&#x2019;s house,&#x201d; the PC said. He pointed down the</p><p>street to a row of small terraced houses before retreating into his col- lar. &#x201c;Number four,&#x201d; came the muffled afterthought.</p><p>&#x201c;God, that&#x2019;s a miserable job,&#x201d; said Ray, as he and Kate walked away. &#x201c;I remember doing a twelve-hour scene watch in the pouring rain when I was a probationer, then getting told off by the DCI for not smiling when he turned up at eight o&#x2019;clock the next morning.&#x201d;</p><p>Kate laughed. &#x201c;Is that why you specialized?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not entirely,&#x201d; Ray said, &#x201c;but it was certainly part of the appeal. No, it was mainly because I was sick of passing all the big jobs over to the specialists and never seeing anything through to the end. How about you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sort of similar.&#x201d;</p><p>They reached the row of houses the PC had pointed toward. Kate carried on talking as they looked for number four.</p><p>&#x201c;I like dealing with the more serious jobs. But mainly it&#x2019;s because I get bored easily. I like complicated investigations that make my head hurt to figure them out. Cryptic crosswords rather than simple ones. Does that make sense?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Perfect sense,&#x201d; said Ray. &#x201c;Although I&#x2019;ve always been useless at cryptic crosswords.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a knack,&#x201d; said Kate. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll teach you sometime. Here we are, number four.&#x201d;</p><p>The front door was smartly painted and slightly ajar. Ray pushed it open and called inside. &#x201c;CID. All right if we come in?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;In the sitting room,&#x201d; came the response.</p><p>They wiped their feet and walked up the narrow hallway, pushing past an overloaded coat rack, beneath which sat a pair of child&#x2019;s red wellies, neatly placed beside an adult pair.</p><p>The child&#x2019;s mother was sitting on a small sofa, her eyes fixed on the blue drawstring school bag clutched on her lap.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m Detective Inspector Ray Stevens. I&#x2019;m so sorry to hear about your son.&#x201d;</p><p>She looked up at him, twisting the drawstring so tightly around her hands the cord gouged red grooves in her skin. &#x201c;Jacob,&#x201d; she said, dry-eyed. &#x201c;His name is Jacob.&#x201d;</p><p>Perched on a kitchen chair next to the sofa, a uniformed sergeant was balancing paperwork on his lap. Ray had seen him around the station but didn&#x2019;t know his name. He glanced at his badge.</p><p>&#x201c;Brian, would you mind taking Kate into the kitchen and filling her in on what you&#x2019;ve got so far? I&#x2019;d like to ask the witness a few questions, if that&#x2019;s okay? It won&#x2019;t take long. Perhaps you could make her a cup of tea at the same time.&#x201d;</p><p>From the reaction on Brian&#x2019;s face, it was clear this was the last thing he wanted to do, but he stood up and left the room with Kate, no doubt to moan to her about CID pulling rank. Ray didn&#x2019;t dwell on it.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry to ask you even more questions, but it&#x2019;s vital we get as much information as we can, as early as possible.&#x201d;</p><p>Jacob&#x2019;s mother nodded, but didn&#x2019;t look up.</p><p>&#x201c;I understand you couldn&#x2019;t see the car&#x2019;s number plate?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It happened so quickly,&#x201d; she said, the words triggering a release of emotion. &#x201c;He was talking about school, and then . . . I only let go for a second.&#x201d; She pulled the drawstring cord tighter round her hand, and Ray watched the color drain from her fingers. &#x201c;It was so fast. The car came so fast.&#x201d;</p><p>She answered his questions quietly, giving no sign of the frustration she must surely be feeling. Ray hated causing such intrusion, but he had no choice.</p><p>&#x201c;What did the driver look like?&#x201d; &#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t see inside,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Were there passengers?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t see inside the car,&#x201d; she repeated, her voice dull and wooden. &#x201c;Right,&#x201d; said Ray. Where on earth were they going to start?</p><p>She looked at him. &#x201c;Will you find him? The man who killed Jacob. Will you find him?&#x201d; Her voice cracked and the words fell apart, morphing into a low moan. She bent forward, hugging the school bag into her stomach, and Ray felt a tightening in his chest. He took a deep breath, forcing the feeling away.</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll do everything we can,&#x201d; he said, despising himself for the clich�. Kate came back from the kitchen with Brian behind her, carrying a mug of tea. &#x201c;All right if I finish this statement now, guv?&#x201d; he asked.</p><p><i>Stop upsetting my witness, you mean, </i>Ray thought. &#x201c;Yes, thank you&#x2014;sorry for interrupting. Got everything we need, Kate?&#x201d;</p><p>Kate nodded. She looked pale, and he wondered if Brian had said something to upset her. In a year or so he would know her as well as he knew the rest of the team, but he hadn&#x2019;t quite sussed her out yet. She was outspoken, he knew that much, not too nervous to put her point across at team meetings, and she learned fast.</p><p>They left the house and walked in silence back to the car.</p><p>&#x201c;Are you okay?&#x201d; he asked, although it was clear she wasn&#x2019;t. Her jaw was rigid; the color had completely drained from her face.</p><p>&#x201c;Fine,&#x201d; Kate said, but her voice was thick and Ray realized she was trying not to cry.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; he said, reaching out and putting an awkward arm round her shoulder, &#x201c;is it the job?&#x201d; Over the years Ray had built a defensive mechanism against the fall-out of cases like this one. Most police officers had one&#x2014;it&#x2019;s why you had to turn a blind eye to some of the jokes bandied about the cafeteria&#x2014;but perhaps Kate was different.</p><p>She nodded and took a deep, juddering breath. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, I&#x2019;m n...</p></p><h2>Companions along the way</h2><p>The one and only Ruth Montgomery has joined forces with the supreme medium Arthur Ford and other companions from the Other Side to pierce the veil of the unknown and shed enthralling new light on the most fascinating depths of the psychic world.

Without taking sides, Shorto draws a fascinating picture of Jesus the man by approaching the topic from all available angles, such as his Greekness, his Jewishness, his miracles, and his message. Although there is nothing in this book that hasn&#39;t been said already, it&#39;s value lies in its easy-to-read, balanced synthesis of the cacophony of scholarly and religious opinions. Not meant as a challenge to the Gospels but as an honest exploration of an issue of profound significance to so many Christians and non-Christians alike.An enthusiastic but overly sensationalized synthesis of ``historical Jesus'' scholarship. Shorto, by his own admission, is not a New Testament scholar, archaeologist, or scientist; he is a contributor to popular magazines like GQ, whose assignment to cover the controversial Jesus Seminar (engaged in an attempt to weed out the true from the apocryphal in the life of Jesus) turned into a book. What you see is what you get: This is one journalist's attempt to explore the ins and outs of the ``quest for the historical Jesus.'' Some of the chapters are illuminating, reporting on the way in which scientific advances have shed new light on ancient biblical ``mysteries'' surrounding Jesus' life and activities: Shorto is at his best when explaining how the DNA of sheepskin parchment can be used to piece together fragments of the Dead Sea Scrolls, for example. The book closes with a helpful examination of how the search for the historical Jesus has influenced spirituality in contemporary churches, though the enthusiastic Shorto overstates the impact it has made on ordinary folks. The greatest flaw of this book is its insistence that scholars' debunking of miracles (particularly the virgin birth and resurrection) is new. Even while quoting past skeptics, from Jefferson to Twain to Albert Schweitzer, Shorto leads the reader into a false sense of the ``radical'' novelty of such critiques. The quest for the historical Jesus has officially been underway for a century, and unofficially for much longer than that. Shorto's synthesis incorrectly assumes a fashionable trendiness to historical Jesus research. What is new is the merger of such research with science and the way in which the search, and the heated debates surrounding it, have filtered down into popular culture via books and magazine articles. Shorto's rather breathless approach offers a simplified, and thus inadequate, portrait of the nature and history of the movement he is trying to legitimize. -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

The best I&#x2019;ve ever seen at Tattersall&#x2019;s.&#x201d;</p> <p>Lord Archer Lisle nodded and tried to look somewhat interested as the overeager Earl of Wrotham waxed rhapsodic over his new pair of matched bays. He was as fond of horseflesh as the next man, but tonight his mind was on another sort of flesh altogether.</p> <p>He&#x2019;d accepted the invitation to Lady Sumrall&#x2019;s annual ball knowing that Perdita, Duchess of Ormond, would also be in attendance. In fact, Perdita&#x2019;s presence was the sole reason he&#x2019;d chosen to come at all. Since both her sister, the former Lady Isabella Wharton and now Duchess of Ormond, and her friend the Countess of Coniston had had their lives threatened by an as yet unknown assailant earlier in the year, the widowed duchess had become the sole focus of their attacks. So far the threats had come in the form of anonymous notes taunting the widowed duchess with the knowledge that he&#x2014;Archer assumed this person was a he&#x2014;knew what she&#x2019;d done last season, when her deceased husband, the brutish sixth Duke of Ormond, had been killed. Never mind that the dead nobleman had been killed while attempting to cut his wife&#x2019;s throat. Whoever this mastermind was, he&#x2019;d appointed himself judge and jury and had found all three women guilty of the crime of killing Ormond. Never mind that there had been no suspicions, as far as Archer knew, from the authorities.</p> <p>Thus far, the threats against her had not persuaded the headstrong Perdita to curb any of her normal activities, a resistance for which she was inordinately proud. But Archer, who had been there for the aftermath of the attempts on the lives of both the Duchess of Ormond and Lady Coniston, was not so happy about her resistance to any kind of curtailment of her behavior. Yes, he wished to see the coward who threatened her thwarted, and Perdita going about as if nothing were amiss did so, but knowing that her defiance put her life in jeopardy frightened him and he wasn&#x2019;t afraid to admit it. And since Perdita refused to listen to reason&#x2014;especially when it came from the mouth of Lord Archer Lisle&#x2014;he&#x2019;d decided to see to it that she remained safe whether she chose to listen to him or not.</p> <p>At present Perdita was waltzing with Lord Dunthorp, a viscount of middling years who had spent the last few weeks dancing attendance on her. Her luxuriant strawberry-blond hair was dressed in a simple chignon that put the fussier styles of the other ladies to shame. And her gown, a cerise-colored silk that was simply cut but hugged her slim figure in all the right places, also put the others to shame. He&#x2019;d seen Dunthorp&#x2019;s eyes wander from her pretty face down to her impressive d�colletage more than once since they&#x2019;d taken to the floor&#x2014;a circumstance that made Archer long to gut the other man, though it would be dashed bad manners toward his hosts.</p> <p>He&#x2019;d been half in love with her ever since they&#x2019;d met. And it hadn&#x2019;t taken long for that half to expand into a whole.</p> <p>It wasn&#x2019;t just because she was beautiful&#x2014;though she was. No, though he appreciated her fine-boned loveliness, it was her spirit that solidified his affection for her. Perdita wasn&#x2019;t an angel. What woman was? But she had a way about her. A sweetness in the way she dealt with people&#x2014;he&#x2019;d heard the servants at Ormond House speak of it&#x2014;that set them at ease. Even her bad moods&#x2014;which were rare&#x2014;were short-lived and often ended with a self-deprecating remark.</p> <p>But the thing that most endeared her to Archer was something she likely didn&#x2019;t even recall. It had been a moment some three years earlier when one of the housemaids had fallen pregnant. There were few secrets in a household as large as Ormond House, and Archer had a strong suspicion that it had been the duke or one of his cronies who forced himself upon the girl. But when the housekeeper had informed Perdita, she&#x2019;d handled the matter with kindness and compassion, giving the maid enough money to return home to the country and with the offer of a reference should she need one in the future. Perdita hadn&#x2019;t considered the matter in terms of its reflection on herself. She&#x2019;d only considered the little maid&#x2019;s feelings. And it had been that bit of selflessness that did him in. From that moment on he&#x2019;d been a goner. And in spite of himself he&#x2019;d fallen all the way in love with his employer&#x2019;s wife.</p> <p>From the corner of his eye, he could see her red gown as they made the circuit of the Sumrall ballroom. He wasn&#x2019;t jealous. How could he be when his position as private secretary to the Duke of Ormond made her virtually his employer?</p> <p>No, Perdita was not for the likes of him. No matter how he might, in his heart of hearts, wish to declare himself to her.</p> <p>&#x201c;I say, Lord Archer,&#x201d; Wrotham interrupted his thoughts. &#x201c;I think Mrs. Fitzroy is attempting to get your attention.&#x201d;</p> <p>Pulling himself together, Archer glanced across the room to see that indeed the comely widow was casting a speaking glance his way. And if he were any interpreter of glances, hers was saying something that was not appropriate in mixed company. The lady had been trying to lure him into her bed for weeks now, but though Archer could appreciate the joys of the bedchamber as much as the next man, he was too busy protecting Perdita from herself to succumb. Then there was the whole unrequited business.</p> <p>He snagged a glass of champagne from a passing footman and took a drink before he spoke. &#x201c;I believe you&#x2019;re correct, Wrotham,&#x201d; he said, nodding to the other man. &#x201c;But I&#x2019;m afraid I have other plans this evening. Lovely though Mrs. Fitzroy may be.&#x201d;</p> <p>The other man touched his index finger to the side of his nose. &#x201c;Say no more, old fellow,&#x201d; he said with a knowing look. &#x201c;Just between us, I&#x2019;ve heard Mrs. Fitzroy is a bit possessive, so it&#x2019;s probably just as well that you not try to juggle her with another woman, if you catch my meaning.&#x201d;</p> <p>Since it was impossible not to catch Wrotham&#x2019;s meaning, Archer just nodded.</p> <p>&#x201c;I hope you won&#x2019;t mind if I have a bit of a try at her,&#x201d; the other man continued, straightening his cuffs as he placed his own empty champagne glass on an obliging side table. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just that I&#x2019;m in search of a new mistress and I like the look of your Mrs. Fitzroy.&#x201d;</p> <p>Archer would have told the other man to be his guest, but that would have implied that he did indeed have some sort of connection with her, so he simply nodded again and the two men parted ways.</p> <p>The waltz having just ended, Archer threaded his way toward the side of the ballroom where Dunthorp had just left Perdita&#x2014;presumably in search of champagne for her. But before he&#x2019;d made it halfway there, their hostess clapped her hands from a position near where the musicians were set up. &#x201c;Lords and ladies,&#x201d; she said once the chatter in the ballroom had descended to a low murmur, &#x201c;if I could have your attention, please!&#x201d;</p> <p>Not wishing to do her the discourtesy of walking while she spoke, Archer paused.</p> <p>&#x201c;I am delighted to tell you that I&#x2019;ve arranged a wonderful bit of theater for you this evening, thanks to the gracious proprietors of the Theater Royale,&#x201d; Lady Sumrall said. &#x201c;For your enjoyment, we have not just one, but three superb actresses: leading lady of the stage Mrs. Alicia Lloyd; her charming understudy, Mrs. Pfeiffer; and the soon-to-be-famous ing�nue, Miss Desdemona Wright. And playing opposite all three is the incomparable Mr. Charles Keating. All starring in a pantomime that is sure to bring everyone to rapturous applause!&#x201d; As she introduced each of the actors, they stepped forward. Archer could see more than one gentleman eyeing the actresses, and Lord Carston, who was rumored to be Mrs. Lloyd&#x2019;s current paramour, beamed, despite the fact that his wife was also present in the room.</p> <p>&#x201c;Let the play entitled <i>The Secret</i> begin,&#x201d; Lady Sumrall said, before stepping aside while the actors took their places before the musicians&#x2019; dais.</p> <p>Intrigued despite himself, Archer folded his arms across his chest as the performance got under way.</p> <p>Mrs. Pfeiffer and Miss Wright stood to one side while Mrs. Lloyd and Mr. Keating took center stage. As both of them remained silent, Mrs. Lloyd stood before an imaginary table arranging flowers, moving them this way and that as she assessed them. Behind her, Keating stormed forward, his face thunderous as he roughly touched her on the shoulder. As she turned in surprise, he brandished an invisible letter as if to admonish her with whatever was written there. Her eyes wide, Mrs. Lloyd clasped her hands before her, pleading with him as he glared at her, his grip on her arm tight and painful-looking. The actress exaggerated her actions, throwing her head and making as if to escape his grip. Then Keating grabbed her by the shoulders and shook her.</p> <p>Though it was obvious that the two were acting, Archer shifted his weight from one foot to the other, the scene making him uncomfortable.</p> <p>From stage left, Mrs. Pfeiffer entered, and stomped her foot. Keating and Lloyd turned, feigning shock. From stage right, Miss Wright entered and gasped loudly. Seeing the other woman, Keating pulled Mrs. Lloyd against him and placed an invisible knife to her throat. Archer watched in dawning horror as Mrs. Pfeiffer clasped an invisible pistol between her hands and pulled the trigger. At the same time, Mrs. Lloyd twisted out of his grasp. Then Miss Wright and Mrs. Pfeiffer rushed toward Keating as he fell senseless to the floor. All three women embraced and stilled, the performance over as the ballroom erupted in thunderous applause.</p> <p>His mouth agape, Archer stood motionless as the three actors took their bows and Lady Sumrall&#x2019;s guests continued to rain praise upon them. Then, he pushed his way through the crowd, desperate to get to where he&#x2019;d last seen Perdita. Because he knew without doubt that she would have been as disturbed as he was by the performance.</p> <p>Not because the subject matter was so shocking. One can and did see more melodrama at the theater every evening of the week.</p> <p>No, she&#x2019;d be shocked by this show for another reason altogether.</p> <p>Because the actors from the Theater Royale hadn&#x2019;t simply been performing a play written for the entertainment of Lady Sumrall&#x2019;s guests. It had been written to instill fear in the heart of one person and one alone. Perdita.</p> <p>The scene hadn&#x2019;t depicted a scene from the imagination of the playwright. It had been the retelling of a scene that was all too familiar to the widowed duchess. Because she&#x2019;d not only witnessed it, but lived it.</p> <p>On the day her husband died.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>Perdita, Duchess of Ormond, stood chatting with Lady Entwhistle on the side of the Sumrall ballroom, slightly out of breath from her waltz with Lord Dunthorp. He&#x2019;d gone in search of champagne for them both, and if she were completely honest with herself, Perdita was slightly relieved to be out from beneath his watchful eye.</p> <p>Dunthorp was a nice enough man, but his unrelenting pursuit of her had become a bit of a discomfort to her in the past few weeks. It wasn&#x2019;t that she disliked him. If that were so she&#x2019;d have sent the man packing when he&#x2019;d first begun to show interest. No, it was just that Perdita, having only last year emerged from beneath her husband&#x2019;s controlling thumb, was not quite ready to call someone else her lord and master. She liked being able to make her own decisions and come and go as she pleased. She enjoyed choosing her own gowns and not having to worry that the bruises Gervase had left on her the night before would show no matter how she tugged down the sleeves.</p> <p>One would think that since her severed engagement to Lord Coniston, she&#x2019;d have learned her lesson about attaching herself to single gentlemen before she was quite sure of her feelings for them. Fortunately for her, her friend Georgina had married Coniston shortly thereafter, so he was none the worse for wear. Not that he would have been at any rate, since theirs had been a betrothal of convenience more than anything else. But Dunthorp was not as indifferent as Coniston had been, and Perdita had no more friends waiting in the wings to sweep him off his feet. And if her intuition was right, he was working up to offer for her sometime in the next few weeks. An offer she had no intention of accepting. And rejection would put an end to their friendship.</p> <p>&#x201c;Are you aware that Lord Archer Lisle is staring at you as if he wished to carry you off and ravish you, darling?&#x201d; Lady Entwhistle asked, jerking Perdita from her reverie. &#x201c;If I had a man of his looks desperate for me,&#x201d; she went on, &#x201c;I&#x2019;d not be wasting time here in Lady Sumrall&#x2019;s crowded ballroom, darling, that&#x2019;s certain.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be absurd, Letitia,&#x201d; Perdita said with a laugh, &#x201c;Lord Archer is simply playing the duenna. He has taken it upon himself to look after me and he&#x2019;s worse than an old mother hen.&#x201d; That she found Lord Archer, with his golden good looks and tall, impressively strong physique, to be devilishly handsome was neither here nor there. She and Archer were friends. That was all, and as she&#x2019;d just been telling herself, she had no wish for another husband.</p> <p>&#x201c;If you say so, my dear duchess,&#x201d; Lady Entwhistle, who was known for her affairs as much as she was for her impeccable taste, said with a shake of her head. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a shame, though, if you don&#x2019;t take advantage of all that deliciousness while you still can. Dunthorp is a nice enough man, but look at Lord Archer&#x2019;s shoulders!&#x201d;</p> <p>Perdita was saved from replying by their hostess, who announced a particular entertainment had been arranged for them this evening. It had been thus since the beginning of the season. Each hostess of the ton had made it her business to outdo the ones preceding her. Thus, Lady Glenlivet had imported a real Venetian gondola to give rides in the pond behind her house in Hampstead, though that had come to grief when Lord Glenlivet had attempted to get a bit too close to his mistress in the boat and overturned it and them in the waist-high water. Then Lady Moulton had hired a pair of acrobats from Astley&#x2019;s to perform in the garden of her Grosvenor Square town house, complete with flaming hoops through which they leaped most impressively&nbsp;&#x2026; until one of the hoops caught a lemon tree aflame and the fire brigade had to be summoned. Now, it would seem, Lady Sumrall had found yet another means to entertain her guests. Though having mere actors perform in her ballroom was a bit of a letdown, if Perdita were to be honest with herself.</p> <p>When the players had finished their little tableau, however, Perdita was gasping for breath and trying desperately to make her way through the crowded ballroom to one&#x2014;any&#x2014;of the doors leading into the rest of the house. She was on the point of shouting to make herself heard above the din of applause when she felt a strong arm guiding her.</p> <p>&#x201c;Easy,&#x201d; she heard Archer say before she could wrest herself from his hold. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get you out of here,&#x201d; he told her, the reverberation of his voice at her ear strangely reassuring.</p> <p>Silently, they pushed their way past what for Perdita was a blur of colorful gowns, black coats, and white cravats toward the French doors at the back of the Sumrall ballroom. As soon as they stepped outside she was able to breathe again, and she gripped his arm tighter than was strictly necessary as he led her toward a picturesque little bower just out of range of the torchlight coming from the terrace.</p> <p>&#x201c;Sit,&#x201d; he said brusquely, and she knew that if she were in a different mood she&#x2019;d have chided him for talking to her as if she were one of his spaniels. But she was so relieved to be out of the ballroom, she lowered herself to the little bench beneath the rose arbor and hugged her arms. It was then that she realized her teeth were chat...</p></p><h2>Rainbows, Halos, and Glories</h2><p>Over two hundred illustrations, many in full color, capture for both the layman and scientist the beautiful otical effects that we see in the sky.

None of this legal crap the human cops were forced to put up with. Of course, the people in front of a guardian's metaphoric bullet were generally out-of-control psychos who totally <i>deserved</i> to die, but stalking the night with the aim of ending their undead lives still wasn't something that had reached my "to-do" list. <br><br>Even if my wolf soul sometimes hungered to hunt more than I might wish to acknowledge.<br><br>But if there was one thing worse than going through all the training that was involved in becoming a guardian, then it was training with my brother. I couldn't con him. Couldn't flirt or flash a bit of flesh to make him forget his train of thought. Couldn't moan that I'd had enough and that I couldn't go on, because he wasn't just my brother, but my twin.<br><br>He knew <i>exactly</i> what I could and couldn't do, because he could feel it.

Any later, and he'd see me as the beaten-up scruff I usually was these days.<br><br>"Isn't Liander cooking you a roast this evening?" I said, casually waving the wooden baton I'd been given but had yet to use. Mainly because I didn't want to hit my brother.<br><br>He, however, didn't have the same problem, and the bruises littering my body proved it.<br><br>But then, he didn't really want me to be doing this. Didn't want me on the mission drawing inexorably closer.<br><br>"Yes." He continued to circle me, his pace as casual as his expression. I wasn't fooled. Couldn't be, when I could feel the tension in his body almost as well as I could feel it in mine. "But he has no intention of putting it on until I phone and tell him I'm on my way to his place."<br><br>"It's his birthday. You should be there to celebrate it with him rather than putting me through the wringer."<br><br>He shifted suddenly, stepping forward, the baton a pale blur as he lashed out at me. I ignored the step and the blow, holding still as the breeze of the baton's passing caressed the fingers of my left hand. He was only playing, and we both knew it.<br><br>I wouldn't even see his real move.<br><br>He grinned. "I'll be there as soon as this is over. And he did invite you along, remember."<br><br>"And spoil the private party you have planned?" My voice was dry. "I don't think so. Besides, <i>I'd</i> rather party with Kellen."<br><br>"Meaning Quinn is still out of the picture?"<br><br>"Not entirely." I shifted a little, keeping him in sight as he continued to circle. The padded green mats that covered the Directorate's sublevel training arena squeaked in protest under my bare feet.<br><br>"Your sweat is causing that," he commented. "But there's not nearly enough of it."<br><br>"Jesus, Rhoan, have a heart. I haven't seen Kellen for nearly a week. I want to play with <i>him</i>, not you."<br><br>He raised an eyebrow, a devilish glint in his silver eyes. "You get me on the mat, and I'll let you go."<br><br>"It's not <i>you</i> I want on the mat!"<br><br>"If you don't fight me, they'll make you fight Gautier. And I don't think either of us wants that."<br><br>"And if I do fight you, and do manage to bring you down, they're going to make me fight him, anyway." Which pretty much sucked. I wasn't overly fond of vampires at the best of times, but some of them&#x2013;like Quinn, who was in Sydney tending to his airline business, and Jack, my boss, and the man in charge of the whole guardian division&#x2013;were decent people. Gautier was just a murdering freak. He might be a guardian, and he might not have done anything wrong just yet, but he <i>was</i> one of the bad guys. He was also a clone made for one specific purpose&#x2013;to take over the Directorate. He hadn't made his move yet, but I had an odd premonition that he would, and soon.<br><br>Rhoan made another feint. This time the baton skimmed my knuckles, stinging but not breaking skin. I resisted the urge to shake the pain away and shifted my stance a little, readying for the real attack.<br><br>"So, what's happening between you and Quinn?"<br><br>Nothing had happened, and that was the whole problem. After making such a song and dance about me upholding my end of the deal we'd made, he'd basically played absent lover for the last few months. I blew out a frustrated breath, lifting the sweaty strands of hair from my forehead. "Can't we have this discussion after I play with Kellen?"<br><br>"No," he said, and blurred so fast that he literally disappeared from normal sight. And while I could have tracked his heat signature with the infrared of my vampire vision, I didn't actually need to, because my hearing and nose were wolf-sharp. Not only could I hear his light steps on the vinyl mats as he circled around me, but I could track the breeze of his spicy, leathery scent.<br><br>Both were now approaching from behind.<br><br>I dove out of the way, twisting around even as I hit the mat, and lashed out with a foot. The blow connected hard and low against the back of his leg, and he grunted, his form reappearing as he stumbled and fought to remain standing.<br><br>I scrambled upright, and lunged toward him. I wasn't fast enough by half. He scooted well out of reach and shook his head. "You're not taking this seriously, Riley."<br><br>"Yes, I am." Just not as seriously as he'd like me to. Not this evening, anyway.<br><br>"Are you that desperate to fight Gautier?"<br><br>"No, but I <i>am</i> that desperate to see Kellen." Sexual frustration wasn't a good thing for anyone, but it was particularly bad for a werewolf. Sex was an ingrained part of our culture&#x2013;we needed it as much as a vampire needed blood. And this goddamn training had been taking up so much of my free time that I hadn't even been able to get down to the Blue Moon for some action. <br><br>I blew out another breath, and tried to think calm thoughts. As much as I didn't want to hurt my brother, if that was the only way out of here, then I might have to try.<br><br>But if I <i>did</i> succeed in beating him, then Jack might take that as a sign I was ready for the big one. And part of me feared that&#x2013;feared that no matter what Jack said, my brother was right when he said that I shouldn't be doing this. That I was never going to be ready for it, no matter how much training I got.<br><br>That I'd screw it all up, and put everyone's life in danger.<br><br>Not that Rhoan had <i>actually</i> said that last one. But as the time to infiltrate Deshon Starr's crime cartel drew nearer, it was in my thoughts more and more.<br><br>"It's a stupid rule, and you know it," I said eventually. "Fighting Gautier doesn't prove anything."<br><br>"He is the best at what he does. Fighting him makes guardians ready for what they may face out there."<br><br>"Difference is, I don't want to become a full-time guardian."<br><br>"You have no choice now, Riley."<br><br>I knew that, but that didn't mean I still couldn't rail against the prospect, even if my protests were only empty words. Hell, if Jack came up to me today and offered me the chance to walk away from becoming a guardian, I wouldn't, because there was no way in hell I'd walk away from the chance of making Deshon Starr pay. Not only because of what he'd done to me, but what he'd done to Misha, and to Kade's partner, and all those countless men and women still locked in breeding cells somewhere.<br><br>Not to mention all the things given life in his labs&#x2013;abominations nature would never have created, creatures born for two purposes only. To kill as ordered, and to die as ordered.<br><br>A chill ran across my skin. I'd only come across a few of those creatures, but I had a bad, bad feeling that before this month was out, I'd see a whole lot more than I ever wanted to.<br><br>I licked my lips, and tried to concentrate on Rhoan. If I had to get him down on the mat to get out of here, then I would. I wanted, <i>needed</i>, to grab a little bit more of a normal life before the crap set in again.<br><br>Because it <i>was</i> coming. I could feel it.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>A shadow flickered across one of the windows lining the wall to the right of Rhoan. Given it was nearly six, it was probably just a guardian getting himself ready for the evening's hunt. This arena was on sublevel 5, right next to the guardian sleeping quarters. Which, amusingly, did contain coffins. Some vamps just loved living up to human expectations, even if they weren't actually necessary. <br><br>Not that any humans ever came down here. That would be like leading a lamb into the midst of a hungry den of lions. To say it would get ugly very quickly would be an understatement. Guardians might be paid to protect humans, but they sure as hell weren't above snacking on the occasional one, either.<br><br>The shadow slipped past another window, and this time, Rhoan's gaze flickered in that direction. Only briefly, but that half-second gave me an idea.<br><br>I twisted, spinning and lashing out with one bare foot. My heel skimmed his stomach, forcing him backward. His baton arced around, his blow barely avoiding my shin, then he followed the impetus of the movement so that he was spinning and kicking in one smooth motion. His heel whistled mere inches from my nose, and probably would have connected if I hadn't leaned back.<br><br>He nodded approvingly. "Now, that's a little more like it."<br><br>I grunted, shifting my stance and throwing the baton from one hand to the other. The slap of wood against flesh echoed in the silence surrounding us, and tension ran across his shoulders. I held his gaze, then caught the baton left-handed and started to hit out. Only to pull the blow up short and let my gaze go beyond him.<br><br>"Hi, Jack."<br><br>Rhoan turned around, and, in that moment, I dropped and kicked his legs out from underneath him. He hit the mat with a loud splat, his surprised expression dissolving quickly into a bark of laughter.<br><br>"The oldest trick in the book, and I fell for it."<br><br>I grinned. "Old tricks sometimes have their uses."<br><br>"And I guess this means you're free to go." He held up a hand. "Help me up."<br><br>"I'm not that stupid, brother."<br><br>Amusement twinkled in his silvery eyes as he climbed to his feet. "Worth a try, I guess."<br><br>"So I can go?"<br><br>"That was the deal." He rose and walked across to the side of the arena to grab the towel he'd draped over the railing earlier. "But you're back here tomorrow morning at six sharp."<br><br>I groaned. "That's just plain mean."<br><br>He ran the towel across his spiky red hair, and even though I couldn't see his expression, I knew he was grinning. Sometimes my brother could be a real pain in the ass.<br><br>"Maybe next time you'll reconsider the option of cheating."<br><br>"It's not cheating if it works."<br><br>Though his smile still lingered, little of that amusement reached his eyes. He was worried, truly worried, about my part in the mission we'd soon embark on. He didn't want me to do this any more than I'd wanted him to become a guardian. But as he'd said to me all those years ago, some directions in life just had to be accepted.<br><br>"You're here to learn defense and offense," he said. "Inane tricks won't save your life."<br><br>"If they only save it once, then they're worth trying."<br><br>He shook his head. "I can see I'm not going to talk any sense into you until after the sexfest."<br><br>"Glad you finally caught the gist of my whole conversation for the last hour." I grinned. "And hey, look on the bright side: Liander's going to be mighty pleased to see you at a normal hour for a change."<br><br>He grunted. "Well, if he wasn't so damn clingy, he might see me early more often."<br><br>I raised my eyebrows at the annoyance in his tone. "He gives you free rein to be with who you want. I hardly call that clingy."<br><br>"I know, but&#x2013;" He stopped and shrugged. "I don't know if I can give him what <i>he</i> wants. I don't know if I'll ever be able to."<br><br>Which was almost exactly what I'd said to Quinn two months ago. It was amazing how our love lives seemed to be following similar lines&#x2013;although my reasons for saying those words to Quinn were entirely different than my brother's statement. Rhoan actually loved Liander. I couldn't say the same about Quinn. Hell, we barely even knew each other beyond the realms of sex.<br><br>And at least Liander had stuck with Rhoan, through good times and bad. Quinn had done a runner yet again, despite his declared intention of not letting me go until we'd fully explored this thing between us.<br><br>How he intended to do that from Sydney was anyone's guess. Maybe he'd simply decided I was just too much trouble and it was better to walk away. Though given we were sharing some mighty erotic dreams, I doubted walking away was a real option for either of us right now.<br><br>I touched a hand to my brother's arm, and squeezed lightly. "Liander loves you. And he'll wait for you."<br><br>Rhoan's gaze met mine. "I'm not sure I'm worth such devotion."<br><br>I raised my eyebrows. "I'm that devoted."<br><br>He flicked my cheek lightly. "Yeah, but you're my twin and my pack-mate. You have to be."<br><br>"True." I studied him for a moment, then said softly, "Just because our pack didn't love us doesn't mean we're unworthy of love."<br><br>How many times had he said that to me over the years? And yet now, when the crunch came for him, he wasn't truly ready to believe it himself.</p><h2>Courage : A Book for Champions</h2><p>Ordinary shelf wear to cover. All pages intact and clean.

He is soon followed by the other dogs in the class, as each in turn escapes. The animals are shown running, jumping, and generally having a good time until they all go "splat" in the pond. The full-color illustrations are attractive and simple enough for children to identify the various breeds. However, while the repetitive "galloping here, galloping there, rollicking, frolicking, EVERYWHERE" will please young listeners, the minimal plot offers little else.

Reprint.</p><p>On a Turkish hillside, ex-Communist mobsters shatter the skull of a corrupt English lawyer. In a sleepy English village, the authorities ask a lonely children's magician how come �5,000,030 sterling just got anonymously deposited in his baby daughter's bank account. With machine-like logic and soulful literary magic, John le Carr� links these two events in <i>Single &amp; Single</i>, a stay-up-all-night thriller.<p> The magician is Oliver Single, the tormented son of Tiger Single, a rogue banker the <i>Financial Times</i> calls "the knight errant of Gorbachev's New East." In fact, Tiger is sinking his fangs into that crucial one-tenth of world trade free of pesky regulations--illegal drugs--and secretly selling donated disaster-relief blood. Mum's the word in Tiger's mob: as the lawyer's executioner notes, "Is not convenient to hear that American capitalists are bleeding poor nations literally."</p><p> Oliver comes in from the cold to help spymaster Brock track Tiger down. That �30 sterling signified Judas's silver, but Oliver yearns to save Tiger's life, too. Le Carr� wizardly juggles dozens of characters in a zigzag, globetrotting plot. You-are-there realism, narrative drive, pitch-perfect dialog--why can't movies be this good? Like lightning, le Carr�'s metaphors both dazzle and blazingly illuminate the world. </p><p> Ex-spy le Carr� was there when the Berlin Wall went up, and his spy craft is legendarily realistic. His female spy/love interest is less so--the opposite of a femme fatale, she might be termed a "deus sex machina." But the book's crucial father-son relationship is quite real, because, like the irresistible villain of <i>A Perfect Spy</i>, Tiger is based on le Carr�'s own con-man dad. The cold war is over, but le Carr� is hot. And he will endure. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p><b>John le Carr�</b> was born in England in 1931.

Since he arrived in New York in the late 1940s to work with Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie, Davis has transformed the jazz idiom, initiating a series of new jazz movements beginning with the cool jazz period in the early 1950s and continuing with the release of the groundbreaking album Kind of Blue at the end of the decade. But the accolades from jazz critics and fans usually end with his late 1960s work; around that time, Miles abandoned conventional jazz practices to experiment with avant-garde improvisation, rock music and electric instruments, using elaborate, electronic postproduction techniques to hone his studio recordings. Those explorations became what is now known as "fusion." Music journalist Tingen meticulously dissects Miles's bands, sidemen and musical techniques, offering a wealth of candid firsthand commentary on Miles and his music from former sidemen like pianist Herbie Hancock, guitarist John McLaughlin, saxophonist Wayne Shorter and other musicians, as well as Miles's friends, lovers and ex-wives. Most importantly, Tingen examines Miles's always turbulent but wildly creative relationship with Teo Macero, his producer at Columbia Records. Tingen can sometimes be at once presumptuous and contradictory, summarily declaring, for instance, that a recording should have been radically trimmed even after repeatedly praising Miles's knack for minimalist masterpieces. Nevertheless, Tingen has written a lucid, detailed and illuminating study of a generally misunderstood, often critically dismissed period in the creative life of one of this country's greatest musical innovators. The book also contains an extensive musician list, discography, bibliography and sessionology. 10 b&amp;w photos, not seen by PW. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Highway: America&#39;s Endless Dream</h2><p>The growth of highways in the U.S. during the early 20th century marked the beginning of an unprecedented American mobility. The democratic, open nature of the road redefined the American way of life and forever changed the way the average American perceives this country. This collection of original full-color photos and historical essays examines the landscape and roadside culture of America&#39;s great highways. 137 photos, 100 in color.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: GermanThere is something distinctive, revealing, and often quite sad about the life along America's major highways. The truck stops, motels, and idiosyncratic roadside attractions are all uniquely American, as is the fate of the towns that grew up along a stretch of highway, succeeded by servicing travelers, and dwindled once newer highways carried interstate travelers elsewhere. Highway is an intermittently effective tour of these precincts, featuring old photographs of roads and (primarily western) highway communities, recent color photographs by Jeff Brouws, and essays by Patton and Polster on the history and influence of some of America's interstates, and on literature and films in which the highway has figured. The essays provide a useful overview, but break no new ground. Some of Brouws's photographs--of abandoned motels and gas stations, dusty small-town storefronts, roads on which neon signs seem the only animate thing--are startling and moving. Too often, though, the view here is one-sided: People seem purposefully exiled from the shots, and the emphasis on decay begins to feel a little self-indulgent and dogmatic. Robert Frank, who usually placed people in even his bleakest American landscapes, remains the master of higway art. Much here seems rather superficial.

A charismatic and inspiring speaker and writer, LaDuke possesses a stirring passion that comes through in the 30 speeches, articles, and fiction excerpts compiled in The Winona LaDuke Reader. This is the first collection of the many political speeches and "think-pieces" that she has written for magazines such as Sierra, Smithsonian&#x2019;s American Indian, and more.</p><p>Winona LaDuke has written and lectured about the issues of Native Americans, women, the environment, economy, and politics since 1979. Her writings have appeared in numerous independent and Native publications, and her presentations have ranged from the United Nations to shareholders&#39; meetings. Her acclaimed novel, &#34;Last Standing Woman,&#34; was published by Voyageur Press in 1997; her first work of non-fiction, &#34;All Our Relations,&#34; in 1999 by South End Press. LaDuke, an Anishinaabe, founded the White Earth Land Recovery Project and the Indigenous Women&#39;s Network and has twice she has served as Ralph Nader&#39;s presidential running mate for the Green Party.A leading member of the Green Party (she ran on the ticket with Ralph Nader in 2000), LaDuke is a well-known advocate of Native American rights and environmental and women's issues, as well as the author of a novel, Last Standing Woman. The pieces gathered here include 38 essays, one short story, and three poems, arranged in sections about Native environmentalism, Native traditions, women's issues, politics, and fiction and poetry. Some of these pieces were previously published in Earth Island Journal, News from Indian Country, Environmental Law and Policy, and other forums. In the essays, LaDuke discusses ideas of traditional ecological knowledge or the culturally and spiritually based way in which indigenous peoples relate to their ecosystems. Subjects include akiing, the Anishinaabeg concept of land ownership, which emphasizes that we belong to the land rather than the land to us; the idea of natural law as the highest law; and the conflict between the indigenous or land-based worldview and the industrial or predator worldview. This collection will resonate with people interested in issues critical to Native Americans and indigenous peoples worldwide. Recommended for all libraries.

This is an experience to share and to treasure.</p><p>Burleigh Muten started to share her exploration of the divine role of women through the ages when she founded Hands of the Goddess Press, compiling and publishing her own calendars. This is her second title for Barefoot Books, joining the well-received Grandmothers&#39; Stories (1999). Burleigh makes her home in Amherst, Massachusetts, USA. Helen Cann is a graduate from the School of Art, Wales. She is a full-time illustrator and her rich artwork has been exhibited in several European counties and the United States. Her watercolour, collage and graphite images adorn many Barefoot Books, among them: The Barefoot Book of Mother and Daughter Tales (1996), The Barefoot Book of Father and Daughter Tales (1997), The Barefoot Book of Mother and Son Tales (1998) and The Barefoot Book of Father and Son Tales (1998).Gr 4-7-Eight myths present the common theme of the powerful goddess while highlighting differences in the folklore of various cultures. Kuan Yin (Chinese), White Buffalo Woman (Lakota), Oshun (Yoruba), and Cerridwen (Welsh) are among the figures whose stories are retold here. The retellings read well and retain details that make them appear to be accurate, although in the retelling of Persephone, Hades does not trick her with the pomegranate seeds-she makes the conscious decision to eat them, having considered the consequence. Though there are no notes specific to each story, a single list at the end implies that Mut&#x201a;n consulted several sources regarding each goddess. Cann's colorful and romantic spot and full-page watercolor, graphite, and collage illustrations will appeal to readers. The artist uses cultural symbols and patterns in these paintings and borders, though the people all have similar features, and the human postures are occasionally awkward. Readers will appreciate this complementary selection of stories.<p></p><p><i>Nina Lindsay, Oakland Public Library, CA</i></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Derby Divas (Zoe Donovan Cozy Mystery)</h2><p>Zoe is busy juggling the demands of friends and family as the town of Ashton Falls gears up for the annual classic car show and demolition derby.

Bill Transformed the American Dream</h2><p>In 1944, the U.S. government feared the flood of returning World War II soldiers as much as it looked forward to peace. To avoid economic catastrophe, FDR, the American Legion, William Randolph Hearst, and others began crafting the Servicemen&#x2019;s Readjustment Act of 1944. It would be the single most transformative bill of the twentieth century. &nbsp;Spun as the G.I. Bill of Rights, this program for vets included home loans, health care, educational funds, and career counseling. The effects were immediate and enduring&#x2014;the suburbs, the middle class, America&#x2019;s ever-increasing number of college graduates, the lunar landing&#x2014;all are tied to the G.I. Bill. The Greatest Generation would not exist without it: Norman Mailer, Bob Dole, John F. Kennedy, Paul Newman, Jimmy Carter, Clint Eastwood, and many others benefited from its provisions. Here are the stories of some of these men and women, how their lives changed because of the bill and how this country changed because of them.</p><p><b>EDWARD HUMES </b>is a Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning journalist who has contributed to <i>Talk, </i>the <i>Los Angeles Times Sunday Magazine, Los Angeles </i>magazine, and others.

A graduate of Hampshire College, he lives in Southern California.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><br>* 1 *<br>The Greatest <br>Regeneration:<br>The Accidental Remaking <br>of America<br>&nbsp;<br>Although he had no idea at the time, Allan Howerton&#x2019;s journey to Denver began two years earlier, on January 11, 1944, when two very distinct road maps to postwar America landed on Congress&#x2019;s doorstep.<br>&nbsp;One vision for &#x201c;winning the peace&#x201d; came wrapped in the pomp and ritual of the president&#x2019;s annual State of the Union address. The other was scrawled by lobbyists a mile from the Capitol, on hotel stationery, then hastily typed up for public consumption.<br>&nbsp;One represented nothing less than President Franklin Delano Roosevelt&#x2019;s plan to expand the Founding Fathers&#x2019; original vision of a just America: giving every citizen the right to a rewarding job, a living wage, a decent home, health care, education, and a pension&#x2014; not as opportunities, not as privileges, not as goods to which everyone (who could afford them) had access, but rights, guaranteed to every American, from cradle to grave. He called it a &#x201c;Second Bill of Rights.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;The other plan, courtesy of the era&#x2019;s most powerful veterans organization, the American Legion, advanced a more modest goal, or so it seemed: to compensate the servicemen of World War II for their lost time and opportunities, offering 16 million veterans a small array of government-subsidized loans, unemployment benefits, and a year of school or technical training for those whose educations had been interrupted by the draft or enlistment. The Legion called this a &#x201c;Bill of Rights for G.I. Joe and Jane.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;The first plan promised to reinvent America after the war.<br>&nbsp;The second offered to put things back to where they were before the war.<br>&nbsp;As it turned out, neither plan&#x2019;s promises would be kept. FDR never got the chance to remake America. Instead, the G.I. Bill did.<br>&nbsp;This was not by grand design, but quite by accident, as much a creation of petty partisans as of political visionaries. Yet the forces set in motion that day in January 1944 would power an unprecedented and far-reaching transformation&#x2014;of education, of cities and a new suburbia, of the social, cultural, and physical geography of America, of science, medicine, and the arts. And just as importantly, the blandly and bureaucratically named Servicemen&#x2019;s Readjustment Act of 1944, forever remembered as the G.I. Bill of Rights, would alter both the aspirations and the expectations of all Americans, veterans and nonveterans alike.<br>&nbsp;A nation of renters would become a nation of homeowners. College would be transformed from an elite bastion to a middle-class entitlement. Suburbia would be born amid the clatter of bulldozers and the smell of new asphalt linking it all together. Inner cities would collapse. The Cold War would find its warriors&#x2014;not in the trenches or the barracks, but at the laboratory and the wind tunnel and the drafting table. Educations would be made possible for fourteen future Nobel Prize winners, three Supreme Court justices, three presidents, a dozen senators, two dozen Pulitzer Prize winners, 238,000 teachers, 91,000 scientists, 67,000 doctors, 450,000 engineers, 240,000 accountants, 17,000 journalists, 22,000 dentists&#x2014;along with a million lawyers, nurses, businessmen, artists, actors, writers, pilots, and others. All would owe their careers not to FDR&#x2019;s grand vision, but to that one modest proposal that was supposed to put the country back to where it had been before the war.<br>&nbsp;There was never anything like it before.<br>&nbsp;There is nothing like it on the horizon.<br>&nbsp;It began with a simple question: Now what?<br>***<br>WHILE president, lobbyists, and Congress debated how best to &#x201c;win the peace,&#x201d; Allan Howerton and the other members of K Company went off to finish the war, sailing from New York Harbor aboard a converted luxury liner, the HMS Stirling Castle, as a military band stood dockside and played, &#x201c;The Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy of Company B.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;Howerton had always imagined sailing off to the sounds of a stirring march, not the latest Andrews Sisters swing, though in truth, he had never expected to sail off to war at all. The Army initially had placed him in a college-based engineering program, with the promise of a billet rebuilding Europe after the war. He spent his first year in the Army at Drexel University in Philadelphia, marveling at his good fortune, basking in a college education he had never expected to be available to him.<br>&nbsp;Then he found himself unceremoniously transferred to the infantry when frontline casualties mounted, and warm, able bodies became far more important to the Army than engineering degrees. The military had abruptly canceled most of its college programs and dumped several hundred thousand soft college boys into boot camp, then shipped them overseas. Howerton bunked in the converted luxury liner&#x2019;s emptied swimming pool as the jam-packed Stirling Castle&#x2019;s long convoy zigzagged to Europe, dodging German U-boats, or so they all hoped. He spent the voyage writing his girlfriend, Mary, and dreaming of his return to her and to his old life.<br>&nbsp;Sixteen months later, with the war won and the occupation and reconstruction of Europe begun, another vessel crammed with servicemen carried a very different Allan Howerton home. After ten days on a stormy Atlantic Ocean, the cry, &#x201c;New York!&#x201d; rang out, and along with hundreds of other uniformed men he dashed to the rails and the upper decks for a first glimpse of home. There was no convoy this time, no zigzagging to avoid the deadly bite of torpedoes, no band waiting on the pier&#x2014;just the coppery green shimmer of the Statue of Liberty, a distant, unreal skyline, and, closer by, the oily New Jersey shoreline, with its modest homes and warehouses looking strange to eyes grown accustomed to the ruined grandeur of Europe. Howerton felt exhilarated, relieved . . . and uneasy.<br>&nbsp;After a few weeks, Howerton mustered out of the Army at Fort Dix, still in his uniform, his future, a path once seemingly so clear and certain, now invisible to him. Damningly, mystifyingly, frustratingly, the uneasiness he initially dismissed had not faded but had taken firm root in his gut and grown. His civilian clothes felt strange and wrong; he could not wear them for any length of time, and so he stayed in uniform, as did many newly discharged G.I.s, caught between two worlds, neither soldier nor citizen. At the Fort Dix gate, a wild impulse seized him to reenlist, to return to the security of barracks and friends he trusted with his life, to orders and orderliness&#x2014; to avoid that most awful question lurking out there in the open air: Now what?<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Never before or since,&#x201d; he would later write, &#x201c;have I felt as alone.&#x201d;<br>***That moment, the Now what? moment, multiplied16 million times over, could either presage a terrible crisis or present a unique opportunity. &#x201c;These men will be a potent force for good or evil in the years to come,&#x201d; predicted Harry Colmery, the former American Legion commander who had scrawled the first real version of the G.I. Bill on stationery from the Mayflower Hotel in the Nation&#x2019;s Capital, and who had warned Congress not to repeat past mistakes with this new group of veterans. &#x201c;They can make our country, or break it.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;Either way, America&#x2019;s leaders seemed to realize by 1944 that they could not put off planning for that Now what? moment until the end of the war. If they waited for the day Allan Howerton glimpsed the Jersey coast, it would be far too late. The numbers of returning soldiers were just too great.<br>&nbsp;In the jaded early twenty-first century, the sum of 16 million hardly seems fantastical, given that the concept of a million&#x2014;in home prices, small-town school budgets, weekly lottery winnings, 401k-plan targets&#x2014;is now all but routine. But it was and is a huge mobilization of men and women unprecedented in our history and unimaginable today, as a much smaller military groans and strains to meet far more modest recruitment goals. To put this mobilization in perspective: Fly over contemporary Southern California, gaze down during the long, slow approach to LAX, observe the unbroken waves of urban sprawl, concentric circles of houses stretching in all directions mile after mile after mile, the endless grid of streets and freeways denuded of nature and filled with humanity and a flowing river of cars as far as the eye can see. Then imagine every man, woman, and child inside that concrete sea of homes and roads abruptly lifted away and marched off to war, and the inconceivable magnitude of harnessing 16 million souls to do anything snaps into sharp, incredible focus.<br>&nbsp;Then consider, as the president and Congress did in January 1944, what would happen when that mass of humanity abruptly returned home and found old careers, opportunities, relationships&#x2014;everything&#x2014;gone or changed or reinvented. The postwar plan, whatever it turned out to be, would hold immense power simply by virtue of this startling number: One out of every eight Americans would serve in the military by the end of the war.<br>Copyright � 2006 by Edward Humes<br>All rights reserved.

This new collection brings together thirty-four of her strong, original stories, from early classics like "The Wait" and "Winter" to six never-before-collected short stories, including "The Legend of Troop 13" and "Wherein We Enter the Museum." An early favorite, "Automatic Tiger," is the first in a series of Reed's stories about animals. There's a monkey who grinds out bestsellers with the help of a "creative writing" app. Her uncanny black dog can enter a crowded room and sit down at the feet of the next man to die. Her characters confront war in various arenas: mother/daughter battles, the war of the sexes, the struggles of men scarred by war. Kit Reed's self-described "transgenred" fiction is confirmation of an "extraordinary talent" (The Financial Times). The range and complexity of her work speaks for itself in The Story Until Now.</p><p>KIT REED's novels include The Baby Merchant and Thinner Than Thou, which won an ALA Alex Award. Her newest is Son of Destruction. Often anthologized, her short stories have been nominated for the Nebula, the World Fantasy, and Shirley Jackson awards and the Tiptree Prize. A Guggenheim fellow and the first American recipient of a literary grant from the Abraham Woursell Foundation, she is the resident writer at Wesleyan University. Praise for Kit Reed "These stories shine with the incisive edginess of brilliant cartoons."&#x2015;The New York Times Book Review (about Weird Women, Wired Women) "Reed has a prose style that's pure dry ice, displayed in dystopian stories that specialize in bitterness and dislocation."&#x2015;The New York Times Book Review (about Dogs of Truth) "She is the SF writer par excellence of the war between the generations . . . Kit Reed frees us as we read her."&#x2015;John Clute, Science Fiction Weekly (about Weird Women, Wired Women)"The Story Until Now provides many, many hours of thought provocation and pleasure, but Reed's greatest contributions to American letters might be her willingness and ability to storm the gates and break down the barriers that prevent science fiction and fantasy from getting the critical attention it so richly deserves."&#x2015;Andrew Ervin, <i>Miami Herald</i><p>"Kit Reed's The Story Until Now is a landmark collection spanning fifty-five years of tales from a career that continues to surprise and entertain, as well as intimidate."&#x2015;Marc Laidlaw, <i>The Cascadia Subduction Zone</i></p><p>"The 34 stories in this genre-bending collection span a period of half a century, from 1960 until the present. Included are some of the author's earliest stories, such as the chilling tale of sisters snowed in with a stranger as resources diminish ('Winter') as well as more recent offerings, such as the haunting 'Song of the Black Dog' (2011). This volume also includes previously uncollected tales, among them 'Wherein We Enter the Museum' and 'The Legend of Troop 13.' VERDICT A master of vigorous writing who takes a fearless approach to her stories, Reed (The Ballad of T. Rantula; The Baby Merchant) demonstrates here her skill at shorter fiction. Fans will appreciate this smorgasbord of tasty stories, while first timers may discover a 'new' favorite author."&#x2015;<i>Library Journal</i></p><p>"It's very rare that one can say there's nothing bad or mediocre about a story collection. The Story Until Now is one such rarity, full of literary gems from beginning to end. Reed Deserves far more recognition than she's received so far, and this collection proves it."&#x2015;<i>Foreword</i></p><p>"(Starred Review) The prolific Reed (What Wolves Know) has been a significant figure in speculative fiction and literature for over 50 years. This impressive tome collects 34 of her short works, including six previously unpublished stories and others gathered from across the expanse of her career. Reed appears to have an essential dissatisfaction with the world, but the manner in which she expresses it varies greatly from story to story: claustrophobic generational paranoia in "Denny," absurdist humor in "The Attack of the Giant Baby," melancholy survivor's guilt in "In the Squalus," and smirkingly betrayed revolutionary ideals in "Songs of War." Reed's fiction shows a remarkable consistency of quality; her prose is carefully shaped, with the clarity of diamonds. Often dark but always worth reading, this collection is a must-have for both those new to Reed and those who have been following her work for decades."&#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>"It's a book worth gettingKit Reed has been producing first-rate work for so long that it would be deeply overstating the case to call her a well-kept secret, but in light of her smaller public footprint we can afford to be a little more expansive here. She's a versatile talent with a thundering grasp of the language and a breadth that ensures no individual story can be used to predict the direction of the story after that"&#x2015;Adam Troy Castro, <i>Sci Fi Magazine</i></p><p>"I've interviewed her, I've seen her at Readercon a bunch, etc. But it wasn't until I sat down and read story after story in the new book that I fully realized just how great her writing is.

Magda, his prostitute next-door neighbor in a fleabag hotel, has found him a job tending bar, and he's trying to master U.S. mores and slang (just as abstruse as his East Anglian lingo). As usual, he interrupts the first-person narration of his adventures with fascinating antique lore, and the marvelous "divvy" chime still warms his chest when he spots a genuinely valuable specimen. This talent gets Lovejoy involved with some extremely rich, extremely peculiar, extremely lethal Americans who are playing a mysterious game. A convoluted series of events takes our hero to a posh yacht on Long Island Sound, the bowels of the W. 42nd Street bus terminal in New York City, the Metropolitan and other museums, a Virginia thoroughbred farm, a glitzy Nebraska religious theme park (operated by Jim and Tammy Faye clones) and a New Orleans riverboat--dodging would-be assassins en route. At last Lovejoy, Magda and her son (at seven already an accomplished thief) hit L.A. for the grand finale of the California game, the scam of the century. In spite of some sloppiness and a few dull patches, this 14th Lovejoy mystery sparkles with Gash's characteristic energy and wit. Author tour. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.Still struggling to reclaim the magnificent form of Jade Woman (1989), in which incorrigibly corrupt antiques-dealer Lovejoy nosed about Hong Kong, Gash now turns to America for inspiration--with only so-so results. Eking out a livelihood in a Manhattan bar, Lovejoy is pressed into waiter service at the wealthy, more-than- slightly-crooked Aquilinas digs, where his ``divvy'' (i.e., divining) talents gain him entry into The Great California Game--an invitation-only, giant hustle that's guaranteed to make the winners multimillionaires. Quicker than he can tell paste from diamond, Lovejoy and his two new street-savvy chums--Magda the doorway whore and Zole the hot-goods kid--are on a cross-country romp (Chicago, New Orleans, L.A.) to set up the sting, while all around them love stories swirl and evolve (the maid/the bodyguard/etc.), two sisters crop up, and, naturally, the big score just seems to elude Lovejoy. A skimpy plot undercuts a wry love-letter to the States. As witty and knowledgeable as Gash can be, he hasn't much of a story to tell here. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

An intellectual tour-de-force that challenges us to see the history of Christianity through the eyes of those who actually lived it.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b><i>Los Angeles Times</i></b><br><br>In this provocative, irresistibly entertaining book, Keith Hopkins takes readers back in time to explore the roots of Christianity in ancient Rome. Combining exacting scholarship with dazzling invention, Hopkins challenges our perceptions about religion, the historical Jesus, and the way history is written. He puts us in touch with what he calls "empathetic wonder"&#x2014;imagining what Romans, pagans, Jews, and Christians thought, felt, experienced, and believed-by employing a series of engaging literary devices. These include a TV drama about the Dead Sea Scrolls; the first-person testimony of a pair of time-travelers to Pompeii; a meditation on Jesus' apocryphal twin brother; and an unusual letter on God, demons, and angels.</p><p><i>A World Full of Gods: The Strange Triumph of Christianity</i> by Keith Hopkins is a rollicking work of revisionist history about Christianity's ascent as the dominant religion of the West. In its tour of Roman paganism, Judaism, Christianity, and Gnosticism, <i>A World Full of Gods</i> employs a range of techniques of description, analysis, and historical reportage. The first chapter is a report from two time-travelers visiting Pompeii just before the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius; soon after comes a description of the ascetic Jewish sect at Qumran that produced the Dead Sea Scrolls--in the form of a TV drama. Hopkins, a professor of ancient history at King's College, Cambridge, justifies his experimental style by asserting that "to reexperience the thoughts, feelings, practices, and images of religious life in the Roman empire, in which orthodox Christianity emerged in all its vibrant variety, we have to combine ancient perceptions, however partial, with modern understandings, however misleading." Rather than presenting a focused argument, <i>A World Full of Gods</i> offers immersion in a sensibility--a history of Christianity that has little interest in the historical Jesus and instead traces the influence of imagination on the growth of Christianity. Jesus, Hopkins argues, "is not just, nor even primarily, a historical person. Rather, like the sacred heroes of other great religions, he is a mirage, an image in believers' minds, shaped but not confined by the images projected in the canonical gospels." <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i><b>Keith Hopkins</b> is a professor of ancient history at King's College, Cambridge, and a fellow of the British Academy.</p><h2>The Letters of Paul: Complete Outlines and Notes on the Epistles of Paul</h2><p>100% Satisfaction is Guaranteed!

Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Charlie Watts, and Ronnie Wood have come together for this remarkable project. They&#39;ve also opened up their personal and band archives to include many rare and intimate images that are interwoven with the text. The book gets right to the heart of what makes the Stones the Stones, as musicians, songwriters, performers, and colleagues. They describe how their music has evolved and how it has affected and changed their lives. They also reveal, with refreshing frankness, how their own lives have helped, or hindered, their music-making. The Stones&#39; own words - insightful, funny, poignant, surprising, and above all, completely authentic - are complemented by insider reflections from key players in their story over the years such as Ahmet Ertegun, David Bailey, and Cameron Crowe. A comprehensive reference section including discography, and chronology, studded with the Stones&#39; personal comments on the music and memories, completes this must-read volume. Here, in their own words and images, is the life and work of a band which has played the soundtrack of our lives for the last forty years.</p><p><i>According to the Rolling Stones</i> hews closely to the formula set in 2000 by the publication of <i>The Beatles Anthology</i>. Like its predecessor, it's a beautiful coffee table tome with hundreds of gorgeous photographs, from childhood pics of Mick Jagger and Keith Richards to concert shots from the 40 Licks Tour. The text is taken from recent interviews with the band's four latter-day members (Mick, Keith, Charlie Watts, and Ronnie Wood). Notably missing, however, is any contribution from former bassist Bill Wyman, who left the band in the early '90s and published his own history of the band in 2002, <i>Rolling with the Stones</i>. Where Wyman is an obsessive collector and diarist, the other Stones are more impressionistic in their memories, lending an approach to history as casual as the band&#x2019;s concerts are rigorously planned and staged. <p> The first half of the Stones story has plenty of high drama (tours through the segregated South, Brian Jones's death, Altamont), which no one seems eager to reflect on deeply. (Charlie is the only one even to mention Altamont.) The more recent years has seen a long string of ever-more-successful tours and ever-less-popular albums, interrupted only by Mick and Keith&#x2019;s near divorce in the '80s, plus rehab stints for Charlie and Ronnie. While <i>The Beatles Anthology</i> offered the surviving members' interpretations of their experiences at a distance of 30 or more years, the Stones are still living the tale they're trying to tell--and they aren&#x2019;t always the most self-aware narrators. Or generous: Wyman's three-decade tenure is given short shrift, but the book finds enough space for some unnecessary digs (Wyman has "tiny hands," we're told, and an "almost effeminate" style of playing).</p><p> To flesh out the band members' own recollections, the book also contains 13 essays from music-industry friends (Ahmet Ertegun, Marshall Chess), collaborators (Don Was), famous fans (Sheryl Crow, novelist Carl Hiaasen), and, yes, even the band's financial advisor for the past 33 years, Prince Rupert Lowenstein. Their views are sometimes fascinating (the unvarnished perspective of Crawdaddy Club owner Giorgio Gomelsky, the well-told stories of art <i>bon vivant</i> Christopher Gibbs), but just as often self-indulgent or sycophantic. Fans looking for an artfully designed volume of photos spanning the Stones' career won't be disappointed. Anyone seeking a comprehensive history of the band may want to wait for the band's definitive biography, which has attempted many times but has yet to be written. <i>--Keith Moerer</i></p>The Rolling Stones formed in 1962 in London and have sold more than 200 million albums worldwide.</p><h2>Before I Met You</h2><p><b>Jazz Age London, a passionate and forbidden interracial romance, and the unbreakable bond between a bright young woman and her eccentric grandmother come together brilliantly in this gem of a novel, perfect for fans of <i>Downton Abbey</i>, <i>Twenties Girl</i>, and <i>The Chaperone</i>.</b><br><br>After her grandmother Arlette&#x2019;s death, Betty is finally ready to begin her life.

The house stood tall and wide atop a hill of dense woodland. In front of the house was the sea. Behind the house was nothing.<br> <br>Elizabeth thought but did not say that the house was clearly haunted and that she would not countenance spending as long as one night in it.<br> <br>&#x201c;Elizabeth, this is my mother, Arlette. And Mummy, this is Elizabeth&#x2014;or Lizzy, as we usually call her.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;When she&#x2019;s being good!&#x201d; Alison, Elizabeth&#x2019;s mother, interjected.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; rejoined her mother&#x2019;s boyfriend. &#x201c;When she&#x2019;s being good. When she&#x2019;s not being good, she&#x2019;s plain old Elizabeth.&#x201d;<br> <br>Her mother&#x2019;s boyfriend ruffled Elizabeth&#x2019;s hair and squeezed her shoulder, and Elizabeth grimaced. She stared at the ground, at the brown and red tessellated tiles beneath her feet, cut and formed into the shapes of stars. She&#x2019;d known this moment was coming for two weeks, since Christmas Eve, when they&#x2019;d gotten the call that had spoiled their Christmas Day. Two weeks ago Elizabeth&#x2019;s mother and her boyfriend had sat her down and explained that his mother, a woman called Arlette Lafolley, a person of whose existence Elizabeth had been blissfully unaware before that moment, had fallen in her house on an island called Guernsey and broken something, and had been advised by her GP that she should have someone living with her.<br> <br>And so it had been decided, somehow, somewhere, behind some closed door or other, that the solution to this problem was for Elizabeth and her mother to leave the only home that Elizabeth had ever known, a neat redbrick bungalow on the outskirts of Farnham in Surrey, and go to this island to live with this woman for at least, her mother had told her, three months, and to do so within two weeks.<br> <br>&#x201c;Elizabeth,&#x201d; said her mother&#x2019;s boyfriend, &#x201c;are you going to say hello?&#x201d; <br> <br>Elizabeth tried not to squirm, but it was very hard not to squirm when you were in a haunted house with your mother&#x2019;s boyfriend&#x2019;s hand on your shoulder, being introduced to a terrible old woman whose frail bones had conspired to crumble and break and destroy your life. Elizabeth lifted her gaze to the woman in front of her but not before noticing, with some surprise, that the woman was wearing red silk shoes adorned with matching rosettes. Elizabeth&#x2019;s gaze also took in black lacy tights over shapely calves, then a coat of full, luxuriant mink that hung from throat to mid-shin, and a face, round and elfin, like that of a child, pink lips, pearly blue eyelids, and a matching mink hat. On each earlobe, a small chunk of diamond shone dully in the muted candlelight.<br> <br>Elizabeth gulped. &#x201c;Hello,&#x201d; she said.<br> <br>The lady in the fur coat paused for a beat and then bowed down so that her head was level with Elizabeth&#x2019;s and said, &#x201c;Hello, Elizabeth. I&#x2019;ve heard a lot about you.&#x201d;<br> <br>It was impossible to gauge from her expression whether these things she had heard had been bad or good, but then her face softened and she smiled, and Elizabeth smiled back and said, &#x201c;I like your shoes.&#x201d; <br> <br>Arlette smiled too and said, &#x201c;Then you have very good taste. Now come in and get warm, I&#x2019;ve lit the fire.&#x201d;<br> <br>Elizabeth and her mother exchanged looks. Elizabeth&#x2019;s mother had met this woman before, about two years ago, when she and her boyfriend had only just started dating. She had described her then as &#x201c;colorful&#x201d; but &#x201c;mean.&#x201d; And someone &#x201c;not to be crossed.&#x201d; She probably had not thought, as she&#x2019;d passed these judgments upon her boyfriend&#x2019;s mother to her daughter, that one day she and her daughter would have cause to come and live with her. And she&#x2019;d probably forgotten ever saying them. But Elizabeth hadn&#x2019;t forgotten. She had come to this place with a full armory of attitude and verve, ready to take whatever this lady had to dish up. And then been momentarily thrown by a pair of scarlet silk shoes.<br> <br>But still, red silk shoes. Even on an old lady, that was rather spectacular. Elizabeth had had to endure all sorts of nonsensical after-school dance classes in order to get her mother to buy her interesting shoes. Slivers of flesh-colored leather with silky ribbons for ballet, and chunky-heeled shoes with buttoning straps for flamenco and jazz. Never anything in red silk. Surely, she thought, surely anyone capable of owning a pair of shoes that magnificent must be halfway decent.<br> <br>She followed the old lady down the hall and into a room on the left. It was entered by a tall door with an ornately stained window in the fanlight.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll have to excuse the damp,&#x201d; said Arlette. &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t opened this room up for quite a while. And it&#x2019;s too cold to have a window open.&#x201d;<br> <br>Elizabeth brought her arms around herself and shuddered. The room was tall and bare, with wood-paneled walls and pointy furniture, and everything was brown apart from a roaring fire in the hearth around which they all huddled on a tapestry-covered ottoman.<br> <br>The adults were all having a conversation about the journey and about the delivery van and about the weather and about Arlette&#x2019;s hip (she had walked with a stick and a fairly pronounced limp down the hallway). Elizabeth got to her feet and went to the window. It was leaded and a touch baggy, and framed by dismal gray nets. Through it Elizabeth could see, in all directions, a vast expanse of blankness. She sighed and returned to the fire, the cold of the room seeping into the very marrow of her, the smell of damp firewood and unloved furnishings and cold, cold coldness leaching into everything.<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got blow heaters coming in the van,&#x201d; said Jolyon, rubbing his hands together briskly. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll plug them in when they arrive.&#x201d; He said this to Elizabeth and her mother in a perky, reassuring manner, but it was clear to them that it would require more than two cheap blow heaters to take the chill off this sad old house. &#x201c;And then,&#x201d; he continued, somewhat desperately, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take a look at the heating.&#x201d;<br> <br>His mother threw him a disparaging look. &#x201c;Not necessary,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;The air will warm up pretty quickly over the next few weeks. Remember, we&#x2019;ve the Gulf Stream here. By the time you&#x2019;ve worked out how to fix the heating and found someone willing to come and sort it for a sum of money that will not make your eyeballs bleed, it will be summer again. Every room has a fireplace. It&#x2019;s all a matter of wearing the right clothes. And keeping to just a couple of rooms. And, of course, lots and lots of hot drinks. Warming ourselves up from the inside out.&#x201d;<br> <br>Elizabeth stared at Arlette&#x2019;s furry coat and hat and thought, Well, yes, that is easy for you to say, you are practically wearing a bear.<br> <br>Elizabeth was put in a room on the first floor that was papered with a green and blue vertical stripe that looked like old men&#x2019;s pajamas. There were three small leaded windows overlooking the sea. It was even colder up here, and when she breathed out hard, her breath appeared around her like a wraith.<br> <br>Her bed sat on the side of the room opposite the windows. It was built from some kind of very heavy, darkly veneered wood and covered over with a cheap-looking duvet with a blue case. Atop the two biscuit-thin pillows sat a threadbare blue knitted rabbit that looked like it had been left there to die.<br> <br>Elizabeth thought of her bed at home. It was queen-size, with a white powder-sprayed metal frame with curly bits in it and knobs made out of clear Perspex. Her mother had bought it for her for her tenth birthday; &#x201c;a double bed for double figures.&#x201d; She also had a queen-size duvet, clothed in a white cover embroidered all over with rose sprigs, and a pillowcase trimmed with lace upon which Elizabeth arranged all her teddy bears every morning before she left for school. She&#x2019;d asked her mum if they could bring the bed, if they could squeeze it into the big van with all their other things, but her mum had smiled apologetically and said, &#x201c;Sorry, sweetheart, no beds. It&#x2019;ll still be there when we get back.&#x201d;<br> <br>And that had been that.<br> <br>Elizabeth rested her rucksack on the floor and unzipped it with icy fingers. Inside she felt around for the soothing plush of Katerina&#x2019;s ears. She tugged at the fabric and pulled her free of the piles of books and games and notepads she&#x2019;d packed this morning to relieve the boredom of an eight-hour journey. Elizabeth pulled the bear close to her face and breathed in the smell, and she felt her heart ache as the heady, honeyed scent of home filled her senses. With her nose still to the bear, she looked around the cold, Spartan room, she gazed at the endless concrete gray of the sea through the mean little windows, and then she stalked across the room, picked up the ugly knitted rabbit, opened a window, and hurled the thing as far as she could into the cold gray yonder.</p><h2>Greek Myths for Young Children</h2><p>The Greek myths are a fascinating part of our cultural heritage, and young children will find these stories of gods, mortals and monsters irresistible.

The New York Times Book Review adds that if by some cruel oversight you havent discovered Amanda Cross, you have an uncommon pleasure in store for you. Pleasure indeed. Amanda Cross is master of the American literary whodunit. In her delicately menacing short fiction, assembled here in one volume for the first time, dangerous impulses seize the most unlikely individuals, and everyday existence is fast eclipsed by the bizarre.<br>With a brilliant touch as light as a butterfly's wing, Cross creates unforgettable characters who probe the baffling conundrums that seek them out: the disappearance of an unpopular university colleague, gone before anyone told her that they loved her . . . the enigma of the nameless toddler who walks out of the bushes one New England summer afternoon . . . the cold-blooded murder of Mrs. Byron Lloyd, shot dead during a writers panel discussion . . . the theft of a seventeenth-century painting from a lonely Texas convent . . . the reappearance of a missing Constable drawing just where it can cause the most trouble . . . and other wonderful mysteries, many of which star the incomparable private investigator Kate Fansler.<br>In a web of irony, wit, and compassion, Cross nets a rich variety of humankind, adjusting the scales of justice so perfectly that readers will rejoice, not only for the consummate resolution of her elegant puzzles but for the excellent company of Kate Fansler and her gifted creator.</p><p>Amanda Cross is really Carolyn Heilbrun, author of the groundbreaking nonfiction book Writing a Woman&#39;s Life, and, like her heroine Kate Fansler, a professor of English. That&#39;s why these 10 stories--written during breaks between her longer works--are intellectual puzzles rather than action-packed adventures. Each one is a cool, bracing spoonful of lemon sherbet for the brain. Cross/Fansler novels in paperback include Death in a Tenured Position, In the Last Analysis, The James Joyce Murder, and A Trap for Fools.When I read THE JAMES JOYCE MURDER, I instantly became a fan of Amanda Cross and her protagonist, English professor Kate Fansler. And I continued to devour this wonderful series: THE QUESTION OF MAX, DEATH IN A TENURED POSITION, NO WORD FROM WINIFRED -- and onward. In time, I (and many other readers) came to realize that "Amanda Cross" is a pseudonym for Dr. Carolyn G. Heilbrun, the revered Columbia University professor whose WRITING A WOMAN'S LIFE and other nonfiction volumes are recognized as ground-breaking classics in literary criticism and feminist studies. My admiration for the author grew and grew -- in both her guises. And then a few years ago, I had the great good fortune to become the editor of her "Amanda Cross" half. Which has given me many opportunities to get to know Carolyn personally (it helps that we live only a few blocks from each other). So I've been in the company of this widely beloved author for autograph parties, bookstore events, an honorary dinner, and recently at the ALA (American Library Association) conference, where scores of adoring fans -- librarians and educators -- patiently queued up to get personally autographed copies of THE PUZZLED HEART, the latest Fansler mystery, as well as backlist titles in the series. Even with the resultant writer's cramp, it was a great day for "Amanda." And another cherished memory I have of this charming, gracious, and multitalented author.<br><br>--Joe Blades, Associate Publisher</p><h2>Home Game: Big-League Stories from My Life in Baseball&#39;s First Family</h2><p><p><b>From the first third-generation player in Major League history, a sometimes moving, always candid inside look at his family&#x2019;s seventy years in baseball</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> A five-foot-ten fireball questioned by scouts because of his small stature, supposed lack of power, and cocky attitude, Bret Boone didn&#x2019;t care about family legacy as he fought his way to the Major Leagues in 1992; he wanted to make his own way. He did just that, building a career that featured three All-Star appearances, four Gold Gloves, a bout with alcohol�ism, and the mixed blessing of being traded three times.

Along the way, his book also touches on Boone family lore, from Ray playing with his hero Ted Williams and Bob winning a World Series with the 1980 Phillies to Bret&#x2019;s flop in a nationally televised home-run derby and Aaron&#x2019;s historic home run in the 2003 playoffs. <br> &nbsp;<br> Blending nostalgia, close analysis of the game, insight into baseball&#x2019;s un�written codes, and controversial thoughts on its future as a sport and a busi�ness, Bret Boone offers a one-of-a-kind look at the national pastime&#x2014;from the colorful, quotable scion of a family whose business is baseball.<br><br></p></p><p><b>BRET BOONE</b> hit 252 homers, drove in more than 1,000 runs, played in 3 All-Star games, and won four Gold Gloves and two Silver Slugger Awards in fourteen seasons with the Seattle Mariners, Cincinnati Reds, Atlanta Braves, and San Diego Padres.

It has been translated into fifteen languages, sold more than 12 million copies, and is the basis for an award-winning German entry at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival. Recounting an incredible real-life adventure, it tracks the destiny of German soldier Clemens Forrell who, in the aftermath of WWII, was sentenced to twenty-five years of forced labor in a lead mine in the barren eastern reaches of Siberia. Subjected to the brutality of the camp and the climate, Forrell dreamed continuously of escape&#x2014;and then daringly effected it. From East Cape across the vast trackless wastes of Siberia, for thousands of miles and three years, with fear as his most intimate companion, Forrell fled treachery and endured some of the most inhospitable conditions on earth. In a long series of taped interviews with esteemed German author Josef M. Bauer, Forrell unfolded his remarkable story of survival. Bauer not only reconstructs Forrell&#x2019;s arduous journey to the Iranian frontier and freedom; he also poignantly evokes the emotional content of Forrell&#x2019;s brave quest&#x2014;emerging as an affecting portrait of a man who strove and triumphed against all odds.</p><p>Josef M Bauer was born in Germany in 1901.

Written with reverent attention to historical accuracy, the book vividly documents the fear, suffering, and intense friendships that are all present on the eve of the battle and during its aftermath. When Bushrod is wounded in the Confederate charge, he is taken to a makeshift hospital where he comes under the care of Anna, who has already lost two potential romances to battle. Bushrod and Anna's poignant attempt to forge a bond of common humanity in the midst of the pathos and horror of battle serves as a powerful reminder that the war that divided America will not vanish quietly into the page of history.<br></p><p>Howard Bahr compresses this moving Civil War novel into 48 hours--two short days filled with grim deaths and the prelude, at least, to a love story. First issued by a small Baltimore press in 1997,<i>The Black Flower</i> was nominated for four major awards, including one from the Academy of Arts and Letters, but failed to garner the attention paid to <i>Cold Mountain</i>. Civil War buffs will rejoice in Bahr's vivid retelling of the November 1864 Battle of Franklin, Tennessee. More to the point, <i>The Black Flower</i> transcends its historical fiction niche and deserves a wider audience. Confederate rifleman Bushrod Carter, the novel's protagonist, is wounded during the battle and taken to a nearby house. In this makeshift hospital, he and two childhood friends huddle together, "shivering with cold and exhaustion, ignoring the ghostly shapes still shuffling through the coiling smoke around them, calling the names of men who would never answer." Bahr has poured 20 years of research into his novel, but this haunting portrayal of suffering and death is the product not merely of historical diligence but also an impressive literary imagination. <i>--Eugenia Trinkle</i>Howard Bahr was born in Meridian, Mississippi.

To give Western readers insight into what growing up in the Middle East was like in the twentieth century, this book gathers thirty-six original memoirs written by Middle Eastern men and women about their own childhoods.</p> <p>Elizabeth Warnock Fernea, a well-known writer of books and documentary films about women and the family in the Middle East, has collected stories of childhoods spent in Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Morocco, Palestine, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, and Turkey. The accounts span the entire twentieth century, a full range of ethnicities and religions, and the social spectrum from aristocracy to peasantry. They are grouped by eras, for which Fernea provides a concise historical sketch, and include a brief biography of each contributor. The introduction by anthropologist Robert A. Fernea sets the memoirs in the larger context of Middle Eastern life and culture.</p> <p>As a collection, the memoirs offer an unprecedented opportunity to look at the same period in history in the same region of the world from a variety of very different remembered experiences. At times dramatic, humorous, or tragic, and always deeply felt, the memoirs document the diversity and richness of people's lives in the modern Middle East.</p></p><p>Elizabeth Warnock Fernea (1927&#x2013;2008) was Professor of Comparative Literature and Middle Eastern Studies at the University of Texas at Austin.... these accounts eloquently portray extended families at work, the needs and responsibilities they represent, and the ways in which modern Middle Easterners never &#34;leave home&#34;... Books of this kind, which reveal the great variety of Middle Eastern Experiences, which bring a human dimension to what otherwise might seem a set of abstractions, and which enable the reader to engage in life events that most of us share, have an important role to play in the university classroom.

The perpetrators are not a handful of rogue companies, but many members of the Fortune 500. <i>Kickback </i>is a sweeping, global investigation into corporate bribery around the world and how backdoor financial transactions undermine democracy and the free market system by lining the pockets of some of the world's worst dictators and criminals. Ultimately, this system affects billions of people by creating conditions that lead to poverty, violence, environmental disaster, and political instability in countries like Nigeria, Bahrain, Costa Rica, and Iraq.<br><br><i>Kickback</i> traces the origins of corporate bribery from the reign of the British East India Company to the methods by which it is carried out today. Traveling across four continents and interviewing police and intelligence officials, convicted criminals, business executives, and corruption experts, David Montero takes an inside look at bribery's pernicious effects. He examines its ramifications at both the individual and national levels--from the murder of a young activist in Bangladesh to a Texas billionaire's dealings with Saddam Hussein, from pharmaceutical firms' payoffs in China to how the entrenched culture of bribery helped destroy the Greek economy. Montero also examines the countermeasures that have been introduced to combat these practices, such as the Justice Department's efforts to halt them and attempts to identify and provide restitution to victims.<br><br>Given the new era of profound uncertainty we are entering--the strength of the European Union founders, the power of China rises, the global economy continues on a path of perilous flux, and allegations mount that President Donald Trump and his associates are possibly tainted by bribery themselves--the stakes for eradicating corporate bribery have never been higher.</p><p><b>David Montero</b> has documented the impact of corruption in South and South East Asia.

Instead, that effort, culminating in Nixon's resignation, would prove to be only the beginning of a deeper political morass that America would face for decades to come. Congressional investigations would uncover for the first time that multinational corporations, through slush funds and bribes, were not only secretly funding political organizations at home, such as Nixon's reelection campaign, but corrupting foreign officials abroad. This new perspective on the corporate abuse of power and its impact overseas would result in the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA)-groundbreaking legislation that, by prohibiting commercial bribery for the first time in history, sought to change how capitalism and political affairs were conducted around the world.</p><p>Now, more than forty years later, we are experiencing a kind of deja vu, as a special counsel investigates whether the president allegedly abused his power, again by obstructing an inquiry into a possible manipulation of the country's elections. Just as was the case in Watergate, whatever Special Counsel Robert Mueller uncovers will likely mark the beginning, rather than the end, of a reassessment of how power actually operates in this country. And just as in Watergate, there is the possibility that Mueller's far-reaching probe may reveal how tightly political corruption and corporate corruption are linked through bribery, just under the surface of American political life.</p><p>Nixon was the recipient of secret corporate donations, which were considered illegal because they should have been disclosed. But the payments, while unlawful, did not compromise the presidential election itself. Mueller's Russian inquiry is directed at a potentially far more serious crime: whether Donald Trump, the head of a sprawling business empire, colluded with a foreign power to deliberately sway the American electorate, committing the very crime that the FCPA has been trying to eradicate since Watergate-the offer of a foreign bribe, a kickback.</p><p>That law specifically states that a corporate bribe need not involve an actual exchange of money; an offer of anything of value, such as a promise, to a foreign government official is sufficient to violate its terms. This is precisely what Mueller is trying to ascertain: whether Trump, his company, his associates, or his family-or some combination of them-offered a promise to Russian government officials, a quid pro quo, that if they helped Trump by manipulating the elections, Trump, if victorious, would ease U.S. sanctions against Russia. Doing so would allow greater U.S. investment in Russia and would benefit Russian officials and oligarchs, the Trump business organization, the corporate interests of Trump's family, and former members of his senior staff, including Paul Manafort, his onetime campaign chairman, and Michael Flynn, his disgraced national security adviser. If the Trump Organization or anyone connected with it did make such a promise, and depending on how that promise was conveyed to Russian officials, the Justice Department (DOJ) would have strong grounds for pursuing an FCPA charge (among others). An FCPA violation is within Mueller's mandate to investigate "any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation." As has been widely observed, Mueller has hired two former federal law enforcement officials with extensive experience in investigating fraud, money laundering, and overseas bribery-Andrew Weissmann, who ran the Justice Department's Fraud Section, which enforces the FCPA, and Greg Andres, who helped oversee FCPA policy in the Criminal Division.</p><p>The drama playing out in Washington starkly highlights the fact that "foreign corporate bribery" can be a deeply misleading term. We have come to regard it, when we think of it at all, as something that unscrupulous companies do in distant countries, so that any impact it has must be contained overseas. If a corporation pays kickbacks to a greedy government official abroad, why should we be concerned? But in a highly interconnected world, bound together by a global market, a global financial system, and the constant migration of people, goods, and capital, corruption rarely stays "out there." Bribes eventually harm Americans, American society, American values, and American interests, both domestically and around the world, in ways that are difficult to gauge.</p><p>Why do firms resort to bribery? The obvious reason is to gain an advantage over their competitors. But illicit payments also buy the illusion of growth in the short term, of increased market share and inflated firm value. It does not take into account the harm that this practice causes to companies themselves: sinking employee morale, diminished profit margins, and the possibility of hundreds of millions of dollars in fines and penalties-not to mention a reputation that will be associated with corruption and deceit. The firms also effectively steal the public's money because the majority of bribery cases involve capital-intensive development and infrastructure projects-such as roads, dams, defense systems, oil extraction, or mining-that are publicly funded. To recoup the bribes involved in winning such contracts, companies conspire with foreign officials to inflate the costs, sometimes by tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars. While the companies and the officials win out, taxpayers are left shouldering the burden.</p><p>Corporate bribes involve a remarkable amount of money: The World Bank has estimated $1 trillion a year, though this may represent the high end; others have placed the amount at 10 percent of the $4 trillion spent annually on global public procurement. Bribery is never just a matter of money, however; it almost always involves power as well. The actual payments are the manifestation of a secretly collusive system that, for most of modern history, corporations have been forging with foreign government officials around the globe. "These bribes are not just a way of doing business. They tell a much deeper tale: the officials receiving bribes are selling the natural resources of their own country. They're essentially destroying that country. Companies are complicit in that," says Michael Won, who retired from the FBI's FCPA squad in 2016.</p><p>Corporate bribery is not a rogue act. IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Alcoa, Halliburton, Chevron, Pfizer, and Johnson &amp; Johnson are only a few of the most prestigious corporations in America that have paid extraordinary fines to avoid prosecution on bribery charges. Many more are under criminal investigation, including, notably, Walmart. The companies that pay kickbacks are not being exploited or extorted; for many businesses in America and Europe, bribery is an active core strategy, a highly organized and sophisticated process, and one that is often approved by the CEO. In a 2011 survey of eleven thousand global businesses, one of the largest studies ever conducted, corporate managers reported that 32 percent of firms similar to theirs paid bribes for contracts.</p><p>The officials whom corporations bribe are often heads of state, not merely low-level tax collectors or customs guards, though bribery at this level also appears to be widespread. Recently settled cases involve American and European corporations allegedly bribing several successive presidents of Nigeria and the former presidents of Panama, Costa Rica, Argentina, and Kazakhstan, to name just a few. Dozens of high-level government officials-ministers of oil or defense, parliamentarians, and vice presidents-detailed in these cases also received kickbacks. Large multinationals have also made payments to political parties in Greece, Nigeria, and Benin, among others, thereby effectively manipulating elections in those countries.</p><p>"Bribery" itself can be a misleading term, as we generally think of it as meaning a simple exchange of money, cash placed in the hand of a corrupt official. Millions of dollars in kickbacks are certainly made in that fashion. But because bribery is perpetrated by very sophisticated operators who seek to cover their tracks, the transactions are rarely that straightforward. These schemes can just as often involve the currency of power, with bribes paid out in favors, or some combination of favors and cash. These arrangements are almost always intricately layered affairs, engineered to be confusing in order to stymie law enforcement. ("If you're confused by this, that is exactly the idea," a British prosecutor once remarked to a jury, as she laid out the convoluted structure of a bribe.) The people perpetrating the schemes often achieve opacity by hiding them behind an innocuous facade, whether a meeting at Trump Tower to discuss child adoptions in Russia or an innocent-looking contract to hire houseboats in the swamps of Nigeria.</p><p>Because foreign kickbacks are widely perceived to be strictly a business issue, the public has also come to view them as causing no real harm beyond the "market." American prosecutors, likewise, treat foreign bribery as little more than a market transgression. As one example, Siemens Corporation, the German engineering giant, was criminally fined by the Justice Department and German authorities for running one of the largest bribery operations in history-in less than a decade, the company paid more than $1 billion in kickbacks in dozens of countries, including some of the poorest, most unstable places on earth. It eventually paid $1.6 billion in fines to avoid being prosecuted, the largest such penalty in history. But Siemens was fined for failing only to keep accurate financial records and for cheating its competitors, not for any impact its corruption may have had in foreign countries. In fact, Siemens paid most of its fines to the U.S. and German governments, and nothing to many of the foreign governments and citizens actually affected by the kickbacks. Since then, the company has avoided acknowledging that its bribes may have caused harm in those countries. Meanwhile, more than three thousand news reports have been published about the Siemens matter, making it one of the most visible and well-documented corruption cases. Yet not a single article in the English language press has attempted to follow the Siemens money trail and its consequences in the countries where the bribes were paid.</p><p>Part of the reason for this misconception is that bribery, unlike other crimes, often plays out slowly, with secret payments flowing between a company and a government over the course of years, if not decades, so its impact is not obvious until long after money or power has changed hands. The result is a slow-motion disaster, leaving economic, political, and social damage that cannot be detected unless someone begins to look for it.</p><p>Once we do become aware of it, though, we begin to recognize that bribery is widespread, and is implicated in major political events and news stories, as well as histories we thought we knew-such as the origins of the United States, Watergate, or the war in Iraq. Perhaps the Trump presidency may yet compel Americans, in particular, to understand the ramifications of bribes. The unnerving sense of violation we now feel is a way of life in many nations of the world. In Greece, Nigeria, Costa Rica, and Panama, to name just a few, citizens have become outraged that foreign corporations have succeeded in interfering with and manipulating their political systems. In this regard, the United States can no longer lay claim to exceptionalism.</p><p>Under the FCPA, the Justice Department cannot bring charges against foreign officials who receive bribes, and therefore cannot openly name them. In court documents, these individuals are designated by references like "High-level Official 1," with their period in office usually detailed as well. Through investigation and reporting, however, it is possible to identify the perpetrators and the regimes they have served. A critical part of understanding the danger of overseas bribery is uncovering just whom corporations are bribing and following the money on the ground, in the foreign country where it was paid. Unpacking the story of the afterlife of a bribe is the subject of this book.</p><p>As I will detail in the coming pages, kickbacks have directly supported some of the most dangerous individuals on earth-men who are directly working against democracy, freedom, and equality. Through bribes, corporations become participants in their repression and violence.</p><p>Assessing the extent of this damage will help explain why the fight to eradicate corporate bribery is so vital. Many important steps have already been taken in this regard. For the first thirty years of its existence, the FCPA was virtually never enforced, enabling the culture of corporate kickbacks to flourish. But in the early 2000s, a host of factors-greater international legal cooperation, the terrorist attacks of September 11, the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the war in Iraq-galvanized the Justice Department to launch the first-ever global crackdown against corporate graft. Although it does not often come to the public's attention, the antibribery effort is second only to fighting terrorism as a priority for U.S. law enforcement.</p><p>This campaign, which has led to more than two hundred bribery-related investigations in the United States alone, has produced thousands of pages of court documents, including internal company emails, memos, and banking information, as well as testimony from dozens of witnesses, corporate-executive defendants, and law enforcement agencies. Thanks to this treasure trove of information, we now know more than ever how the system operates, particularly which companies are involved; how much they are paying in bribes and for what contracts; how these companies use middlemen and criminals to gain access; and how companies route and hide the payments through a complex system of fake contracts, altered receipts, hidden shell companies, and offshore bank accounts. In the last ten years alone, two dozen prosecutors at the Justice Department's Fraud Section in Washington, D.C., have brought a record number of FCPA prosecutions, ramped up the stakes for offenses, and placed long-overdue pressure on companies to reform from within.</p><p>Even as President Trump refuses to discuss his own questionable relationship with Russia, he has been an outspoken critic of efforts to stop bribery. In a 2012 interview with CNBC he said: "Now every other country goes into these places and they do what they have to do. It's a horrible law and it should be changed," adding, "I mean, we are like the policemen for the world. It's ridiculous." Trump's views do not seem to have changed since entering the White House. According to a 2017 article in the New Yorker, he complained to then secretary of state Rex Tillerson that the FCPA unfairly penalized American companies for paying bribes.</p><p>The Trump administration is already endeavoring to turn this position into policy, appointing an outspoken critic of the FCPA, Jay Clayton, to chair the Securities and Exchange Commission, the regulatory body that is responsible for enforcing the FCPA in conjunction with the Justice Dep...</p></p><h2>Field Artillery and Firepower</h2><p>This definitive overview of the development and use of artillery makes the complex artillery systems of today understandable, while at the same time showing how they have evolved and how they are likely to change in the future. The author, until recently chief of artillery for the British Army, is considered one of the world's foremost experts on the subject. Unlike other books that either describe the technical aspects of present-day firepower or outline its history during specific wars, this work provides both a detailed explanation of the modern artillery system and a history of its development over the past six hundred fifty years, identifying its enduring principles and changing practices against an ever-changing background of technology, tactics, and strategy. When an earlier version of this book was published in 1989, it became known as the best single source on field artillery in the English language. This new edition has been fully updated and substantially expanded to cover a wide range of contemporary military debates and the role of firepower, and is certain to be regarded as the ultimate work on the subject for years to come.<br><p>J.B.A. Bailey assesses major developments over the past decade, analyzing artillery operations in airborne, urban, littoral, desert, jungle, mountain, arctic, and nocturnal environments. He examines direct fire, counterfire, the suppression of enemy air defenses, and force protection methods. He explains field artillery from its primitive beginnings to its dominance as an art in World War II and its potent utility in operations since 1945 and into the future. The book will be of particular interest to military historians and those engaged in debating firepower's future.</p></p><p>J.B.A. Bailey is a major general in the British Army, who has been responsible for the Army&#39;s future concepts, force development, and doctrine."...a treasure trove of insights of great value to every serious student of military operations." --<i>Australian Army Journal, Winter 2004</i></p><h2>They Whisper: A Novel</h2><p>Recalling all the women he has ever loved, public relations man Ira Holloway explores his sexuality and the profound hold it has on him. By the author of A Good Scent from a Strange Mountain. 75,000 first printing.</p><p>Robert Olen Butler teaches creative writing at McNeese State University.Known for the psychological acuity of his six previous novels and for the short story collection, A Good Scent from a Strange Mountain , for which he won the Pulitzer last year, Butler here moves into new territory. This is a literary novel about the physical chemistry of sensual love, told in lyrical prose via a sensitive narrator who venerates the memories of the many women with whom he has coupled, and who "hears" the whispers of their voices, which are interwoven into the text. At 35, Ira Holloway is a man who lives intensely through his senses; the slightest visual or olfactory stimulation releases sensual memories, which he recollects in a highly charged stream of consciousness. Holloway's sexual experiences go back to his youth in Wabash, Ill., his service in Vietnam, his affairs in Zurich and in New York, where he currently works in public relations. But Holloway is not a conventional, and thereby contemptible, womanizer; he is a man whose eroticism is coupled with a true appreciation of female sexuality and respect for women as individuals. More than a mere litany of sexual unions, the novel is, au fond , the record of Holloway's tormented marriage to a woman in the grip of a religious obsession that accelerates from eccentric to insane, and the anguished decisions he makes for the sake of their son. While the descriptions of erotic love are integral to the plot, the highly charged sensuality, the details of the rising stages of lust and the relentless stream-of-consciousness monologue sometimes grow wearisome. Some may empathize with Holloway when he confesses: "I can become a little overwhelmed by the vast chorus that sings all around me, all the women, their throats throbbing in an Ode to Joy." 75,000 first printing; author tour. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Stoneheart Trilogy, Book Three: Silvertongue (The Stoneheart Trilogy, 3)</h2><p>The battle between the statues and the gargoyles in London rages on, and twelve-year-old George Chapman and his friend Edie are caught in the middle.

Along the distant hillside, still green from the winter rains, a tiny man in faded suntans was chasing an invisible ball. She had been watching him for some time before she noticed that he handled his club in an unusual way. He was teaching himself to play golf with one hand. She hoped he had been left-handed to begin with.<br><br> She forgot the tiny man when she heard Bret&#x2019;s footsteps behind her. He turned her toward him, holding her by the shoulders in a grip that almost hurt and studying her face. Looking up into his calm eyes, she understood the doubt that lay behind them.

That&#x2019;s the news of the week.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The news of the year for me. I remembered the whole thing. It was so real I thought it was happening over again. I could see the rice paddies above the harbor in the glare of the explosion. It was so bright it blinded me.&#x201d;<br> <br>She was dismayed by his sudden pallor. Along his hairline there was a row of minute sweat drops that the February sun did not account for.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t talk about it if it&#x2019;s painful, darling.&#x201d;<br> <br>He had turned away and was looking across the lawn, which sloped down from the veranda into the valley holding the sunshine like a lake of light. Its very peace, she thou�ght, must make it seem more dreamlike to his unpeaceful mind than the remembered terraces of that island off Japan.<br> <br>The silence between them was too full of echoes, and she broke it with the first words that entered her head. &#x201c;I had fruit salad for lunch. I had to wait twenty minutes to get into the dining-room, but they do make good fruit salad at the Grant.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Do they still put avocado in it?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I bet you didn&#x2019;t eat the avocado.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s always been too rich for me,&#x201d; she answered happily. He was remembering everything again.<br> <br>&#x201c;We had avocado salad for lunch on Wednesday or Thursday. No, it was Wednesday, the same day I had my hair cut.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I like you with your hair cut short. I always have.&#x201d;<br> <br>The direct compliment embarrassed him. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s convenient for swimming anyway. I didn&#x2019;t tell you I was swimming on Thursday.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, I didn&#x2019;t know.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I expected to be afraid of the water, but I wasn&#x2019;t. I swam under water the full length of the pool. I soon get tired of swimming in a pool though. I&#x2019;d give anything to get into the surf again.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Would you really? I&#x2019;m so glad.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, I don&#x2019;t know. I may have had an idea you&#x2019;d hate the sea.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I hated the idea of it for a while, but I don&#x2019;t any more. Anyway I could never hate La Jolla.&#x201d;<br> <br>The happiness inside her pressed tears into her eyes. La Jolla had only one meaning for her; it was the place where they had met. <br><br>&#x201c;Remember the day the seals came in?&#x201d; She winced at her word &#x201c;remember.&#x201d; It was always coming up, like the word &#x201c;see&#x201d; when one was talking to a blind man.<br> <br>He leaned forward abruptly in his chair, his hunched shoulder muscles stretching his uniform tight. Have I made a mistake? she thought in terror. It was so hard to preserve her balance between a soothing therapeutic attitude and the irrational love she felt for him.<br> <br>All he said was: &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll have to go back there together&#x2014;soon. It seems incredible that it&#x2019;s only fifteen miles from here.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I know you&#x2019;ll be able to go soon. You&#x2019;re getting so much better.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You honestly think so?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You know you are.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Some days I feel perfectly well,&#x201d; he said slowly. &#x201c;I can hardly wait to get back to work. Then my mind comes to a blank space, and I feel as if I&#x2019;m back where I started. Have you ever imagined a total vacuum? A place where there&#x2019;s no air, no light, no sound? Not even darkness, not even silence. I guess it&#x2019;s death my mind comes up against. I guess I&#x2019;m partly dead.&#x201d;<br> <br>She put her hand over his taut fingers, which were gripping the arm of his chair. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re very much alive, Bret. You&#x2019;re making a perfect comeback.&#x201d; But his gloomy tension alarmed her and set her thinking. What if she wasn&#x2019;t good for him? What if he&#x2019;d be better off without her? No, that couldn&#x2019;t be true. The doctor had told her more than once that she was just what he needed, that she gave him something to live for.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s taking a long time,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Sometimes I wonder if I&#x2019;ll ever get out of this place. Sometimes, I don&#x2019;t really want to. I feel a little bit like Lazarus. He couldn&#x2019;t have been very happy when he came back and tried to take up his life where he left off.&#x201d;<br> She told him sharply: &#x201c;You mustn&#x2019;t talk like that. Your life isn&#x2019;t half over, darling. You&#x2019;ve only been ill for less than a year.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It feels as long as prehistoric time.&#x201d; He had enough humor to smile at his own hyperbole.<br> <br>&#x201c;Forget the past,&#x201d; she said impulsively.<br> <br>&#x201c;I have to remember it first.&#x201d; He smiled again, not a good smile, but it was something.<br> <br>&#x201c;You are remembering it. But you can think of the future too.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll tell you what I do think about a good deal of the time.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I think of us together. It&#x2019;s thinking of that that keeps me going. It must be hard for you to be a hospital widow.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A hospital widow?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes. It must be hard for a woman to have a husband in a mental ward. I know a lot of women would clear out and get a divorce&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But, darling.&#x201d; It would have been so much easier to pass it over or to humor his delusion, but she stuck to the difficult truth. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not your wife, Bret.&#x201d;<br> <br>He looked at her blankly. &#x201c;You said you didn&#x2019;t use your married name&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;My married name is Pangborn. I told you I divorced my husband.&#x201d;<br> <br>She watched the manhood draining out of his face and could think of no way to rescue it. &#x201c;I thought we were married,&#x201d; he said in a high, weak voice. &#x201c;I thought you were my wife.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You have no wife.&#x201d; She didn&#x2019;t trust herself to say anything more.<br> <br>He was searching desperately for some excuse, for anything to mitigate his shame. &#x201c;Are we engaged then? Is that what it was? Are we going to be married?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;If you will have me.&#x201d; There was no atom of irony in any crevice of her mind.<br> <br>He got out of his chair and stood awkwardly and miserably in front of her. His blunder had shaken him badly. &#x201c;I guess it&#x2019;s time for you to go. Will you kiss me good-bye?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d die if I couldn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br> <br>His mouth was soft and uncertain, and he held her very gently. He left her abruptly then, as if he could not bear to stay with her any longer after his humiliation. She was proud of the way he went back to his room alone, like any normal man retiring to his hotel room, but his mistake had shocked and worried her. She had had him in her grasp for a moment, and then he had slipped away again, to a place where she did not dare to follow.</p><h2>Stitch by Stitch: A Home Library of Sewing, Knitting, Crochet and Needlecraft Volume 3</h2><p>I this volume...Lacy motifs crocheted together to make an elegant tablecloth.

In 1992, after she underwent a mastectomy, her kidneys failed and she began dialysis at her home in Arizona. She suffered from polycystic kidney disease, a hereditary complaint. Even with her illness, Bombeck continued her weekly schedule of housework, her source for the hilarious columns and books for which she was widely loved.</p><p>"My type of humor is almost pure identification," she once told <em>The New York Times</em>. "A housewife reads my columns and says, 'But that's happened to me! I know just what she's talking about!'</p><p>"If I didn't do my own housework, then I have no business writing about it. I spend 90 percent of my time living scripts and 10 percent writing them."</p><p>Erma Bombeck's books include <em>Motherhood: The Second Oldest Profession</em>, which spent an entire year in the Number One spot on <em>The New York Times</em> bestseller list; <em>Family: The Ties That Bind...and Gag!</em>; <em>If Life Is a Bowl of Cherries, What Am I Doing in the Pits?</em>; <em>I Want to Grow Hair, I Want to Grow Up, I Want to Go to Boise</em>; <em>When You Look Like Your Passport Photo, It's Time to Go Home</em>, which was a <em>New York Times</em> bestseller and the sixth biggest selling nonfiction book of 1991; and <em>A Marriage Made in Heaven...Or Too Tired for an Affair.</em></p><p>There are over twenty million copies of Erma shelved, and her thrice-weekly syndicated columns reached an estimated thirty million readers every week.</p><p>Bombeck was a regular on ABC-TV's <em>Good Morning America</em> for eleven years. She holds fifteen honorary doctorates, has been named to the list of the 25 Most Influential Women in America by the World Almanac since 1979, and was appointed by President Jimmy Carter to the President's Advisory Committee for Women when it was formed in 1978.</p><p>She is survived by her husband, William Bombeck, her mother, Erma Harris, and her three children.</p>One doesn&#39;t have to be a fan of Erma Bombeck to find something interesting and compelling in this audio. With all-knowing sarcasm and wit Bombeck serves up timeless tales of laughter and love which have defined couples since Adam and Eve. Some of her observations will have you laughing out loud. Bombeck&#39;s narration is truthful and real in a way no actor could improve on. This is a wonderful text for audio presentation with stylish music added. If your life is filled with kids, dogs, neighbors and a mate who needs to control the television remote, Bombeck explains it all to you. M.R.

The author&#39;s first mystery.</p><p>Tom Kakonis is a retired professor of English at Calvin College. He lives near Grand Rapids, Michigan.Well plotted, tautly paced and entertaining all the way, Kakonis's first novel focuses on an English professor gone wrong. A few years back, Waverly caught his wife in bed with another man, and the murderous aftermath led him into seven years of very hard time in state prison that toughened him up but simultaneously made him curiously vulnerable to certain things and people. Now, he is applying his exceptional powers of concentration to cards and making a nice living. The last thing he needs is poor little rich girl Holly Clemmons and her ne'er-do-well brother, a self-destructive lunatic who is trying to rip off a drug shipment from the mob. There are other satisfactorily gothic villains here, ranging from a Mafia smoothie named Dietz, to his hemorrhoidal henchman Gaylor Ledbetter, hitman "Shadow," a pathological knifeman, and "Gleep," a hulking muscle-man. In the climactic scene, the hero wages a nightmarish war with a contract killer who just keeps on coming no matter what is thrown at him. Kakonis's prose is clipped, idiomatic and funny in this literate thriller. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Fracture</h2><p><p>Eleven minutes passed before Delaney Maxwell was pulled from the icy waters of a Maine lake by her best friend Decker Phillips. By then her heart had stopped beating. Her brain had stopped working. She was dead. And yet she somehow defied medical precedent to come back seemingly fine<br>-despite the scans that showed significant brain damage. Everyone wants Delaney to be all right, but she knows she's far from normal. Pulled by strange sensations she can't control or explain, Delaney finds herself drawn to the dying. Is her altered brain now predicting death, or causing it?</p><br><p>Then Delaney meets Troy Varga, who recently emerged from a coma with similar abilities. At first she's reassured to find someone who understands the strangeness of her new existence, but Delaney soon discovers that Troy's motives aren't quite what she thought. Is their gift a miracle, a freak of nature-or something much more frightening?</p><br><p>For fans of best-sellers like<i> Before I Fall</i> and<i> If I Stay</i>, this is a fascinating and heart-rending story about love and friendship and the fine line between life and death.</p></p><p><p><b>Megan Miranda </b>was a scientist and high school teacher before writing Fracture, which came out of her fascination with scientific mysteries-especially those associated with the brain. Megan has a BS in biology from MIT and spent her post-college years either rocking a lab coat or reading books. She lives near Charlotte, North Carolina, where she volunteers as an MIT Educational Counselor. Fracture is her first novel.<br>www.meganmiranda.com</p>Seventeen-year-old Delaney Maxwell has the chance for a do-over. She survived the seemingly unsurvivable&#x2014;11 minutes beneath water, before being pulled out. But her survival has come with a price: she now has the ability to sense when another person is near death. She is drawn to Troy Varga, another accident survivor, who has her same ability, but while he tries to shorten the suffering of the dying and help them towards death, Delaney is determined to save them. The unique plot would be enough to draw YA readers to Miranda&#x2019;s first novel, but add multifaceted characters, a true-to-life high-school setting&#x2014;complete with all the cliques&#x2014;and the fearful love-hate relationship with Troy, not to mention a love affair between Delaney and the boy who saved her, and the novel has further appeal. Pair this with Cynthia Voigt&#x2019;s Izzy, Willy-Nilly (2005), Wendelin Van Draanen&#x2019;s The Running Dream (2011), and Davida Wills Hurwin&#x2019;s A Time for Dancing (1995) for interesting reads on living life in the midst of death.

Meier, a Moscow correspondent for Time magazine from 1996 to 2001, attempted to answer the question by traveling to the four corners of Russia so he could report on the suffering of the people as they struggle to survive in the ruins of the Soviet experiment. He began in 2000 by going south to war-devastated Chechnya, particularly the town of Aldy, a district of Grozny, which earlier that year had endured the massacre of at least 60 of its citizens by Russian soldiers. He then traveled north, above the Arctic Circle, to the heavily polluted industrial city of Norilsk, originally a labor camp and now "a showcase for the ravages of unbridled capitalism," where descendants of the prisoners still mine for precious metals. Finally, he went west to St. Petersburg, "a den of thieves and compromised politicians" whose much-heralded revival is largely unrealized and where the people are still haunted by the assassination in 1998 of Galina Vasilievna Starovoitova, the country's leading liberal. After talking to scores of people-from survivors of the Aldy massacre to a harrowed Russian lieutenant colonel who runs the body-collection point closest to the Chechen battleground-Meier paints in this heartbreaking book a devastating picture of contemporary life in a country where, as one man put it, people have "lived like the lowest dogs for more than eighty years."

But then a badly disguised stranger offers to pay generously to hold a very secret meeting there shortly before the national election. And soon one of the mystery guests is murdered in his bath, a local grade school teacher goes missing, and a little boy is kidnapped. With Pretty Boy Floyd rumored to be somewhere near, the nasty business smacks of underworld activity -- or possible political conspiracy aimed at sabotaging Roosevelt's election. Either way, Chief Howard Walker has nowhere to house all the suspects except at the local Hospital for the Criminally Insane. And the Brewster siblings are going to have their hands full tying the various ends together . . . and ferreting out the killer who abused their hospitality.</p></p><p><p>Jill Churchill has won the Agatha and Macavity Mystery Readers awards and was nominated for an Anthony Award for her bestselling Jane Jeffry series.

Siblings Robert and Lily Brewster, genteel victims of the '29 crash, run a guesthouse at Grace and Favor Cottage. On the eve of the 1932 presidential election, a "Mr. Smith" offers Robert and Lily $500 as a down payment on rooms for himself and three of his "business associates," who wish to hold a private meeting over several days. Can these men be gangsters, desperate Hoover supporters plotting to stop FDR at the last minute, or even Reds out to disrupt the election? Badly in need of cash, brother and sister reluctantly agree to the arrangement. When one of their mysterious guests gets murdered in his bath, Robert and Lily have even more cause to regret their decision. The victim turns out to be Brother Mark Luke Goodheart, a scoundrel who preached love and goodwill on the radio while fleecing the poor, the indigent and orphans. Lending some mild suspense are the disappearance of a local school teacher, the brief kidnapping of the boy Joey Towerton and Joey's mother's wait to learn whether her husband has been killed while working on Hoover Dam.

I panic. I almost drop one of the bottles in my haste to get it back on the shelf, and I simply abandon my half-full cart in the aisle. By the time I push my way past dawdling shoppers, make it to the parking lot, and stumble into my Jeep, the pains have gone from intermittent to continuous, and the visual migraine has kicked in. It&#x2019;s as if something has taken a bite out of my right eye&#x2019;s field of vision, leaving behind a circle of serrated tooth marks. Within five minutes, that circle will uncoil into a straight line of marching <i>V</i>s and begin pulsing with gray and orange shadows.</p><p><i>Fuck!</i> I think as I try to start the car, my hands so shaky that I almost don&#x2019;t have the strength to turn the key. <i>This isn&#x2019;t supposed to happen for at least another week!</i></p><p>Normally I have about an hour between the first tendrils of pain and the onset of transformation, but the timing is off, so who knows what else might be affected? I&#x2019;m in broad daylight on the busiest street in Quinville on a Wednesday afternoon. Oh God, if I change here, everyone in the world will see me&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>I finally get the motor to catch and I screech out of the parking lot and onto Highway 159 as fast as I can, cutting off some poor old woman in a beat-up sedan who&#x2019;s trying to turn left into the grocery store. I&#x2019;m calculating in my head. Quinville makes a modest clump of civilization along both sides of 159, but within five miles, the road will shake off the urban clutter as it heads back into open Illinois farmland. Say ten minutes to get clear of the worst of the traffic. Another twenty minutes till I reach the County Road W turnoff. If I can make it that far, I can just pull off the road, cut the engine, and wait for disaster to strike. Thirty minutes. Surely my body can hold on that long.</p><p>I&#x2019;m stuck behind three cars at the longest light in town; otherwise, I would have been tempted to run it when it turned red. The back spasms have morphed into a slow, steady thrum, not unbearable, but the migraine is starting to build; I lean my skull against the headrest and let terror and pain fight for dominance. I squint against the sunlight and the flashing visual cues, wishing I had my sunglasses with me. Keeping my left hand on the wheel, I fish in my purse till I find my cell phone. The light changes to green just as I open my list of contacts, so I hurriedly push the first name that comes up.</p><p>It happens to be Celeste&#x2019;s, and of course she doesn&#x2019;t answer. &#x201c;Listen, it&#x2019;s Karadel. I&#x2019;m heading home, and I&#x2019;m about to <i>change</i>. Don&#x2019;t know how far I&#x2019;ll get. I&#x2019;m going to need someone to come get me. I&#x2019;m going to call everybody, so whoever gets there first&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>Traffic is slow enough to allow me to call and leave messages with Bonnie and Aurelia as well, but then we clear the last light and cars start moving at the speed limit. I&#x2019;m too rattled to try to drive and talk at the same time, plus the pulsing lights of the migraine aura are making it hard for me to see the road. I toss the phone onto the passenger&#x2019;s seat, clench both hands on the wheel, and concentrate on driving.</p><p>For about three miles outside of Quinville, Highway 159 maintains two lanes in each direction, divided by a sad strip of prairie grass and flowering weeds, but soon enough it will slim down to two lanes separated only by a double yellow line. Every driver&#x2019;s goal is to get ahead of the slowest-moving vehicles before those lanes converge. Theoretically, you can pass cars at a dozen spots in the next thirty miles, but practically speaking, those opportunities are few because the oncoming traffic rarely lets up long enough for you to take the chance.</p><p>Like the red Camaro ahead of me and the black Escalade behind me, I&#x2019;m in the inside lane going as fast as road conditions will permit, just praying that no one swerves into my path or comes to a sudden stop, because I&#x2019;m in no condition to make defensive-driving maneuvers. I&#x2019;m barely alert enough to recognize that I&#x2019;m running out of road. The Camaro guns its motor and zips ahead of a rusted-out old Ford pickup, but I don&#x2019;t react quickly enough, and the truck eases over in front of me at a maddeningly leisurely pace. I brake so hard that the Escalade looms menacingly in my rearview mirror, but nobody hits anybody, and we all continue down the road at a greatly reduced rate of speed.</p><p>The near-miss has dumped adrenaline into my veins. Great&#x2014;now my heart is pounding as well as my head, and my hands feel rubbery on the wheel. I&#x2019;ve lost much of my peripheral vision, but darkness hasn&#x2019;t started encroaching on my eyesight yet. How much time left now? Fifteen minutes? Twenty?</p><p>Not nearly enough time to get to my house.</p><p>I shift my grip, take a deep breath, and stare so fiercely at the road ahead of me that my eyes would start burning if they weren&#x2019;t already hot. Maybe five minutes to the turnoff. I can make it that far. I have to. The pickup has slowed to something like forty miles an hour, but that might be a good thing; I can sort of keep things together at this speed. To my left, an unbroken line of family cars, 18-wheelers, motorcycles, and SUVs whooshes past. The driver of the Escalade is riding impatiently close to my bumper, and I know he&#x2019;ll take the first chance he sees to pass both me and the pickup. But even if the oncoming traffic were to thin down to nothing, leaving a straight and empty stretch of road bordered by cornfields on either side, I wouldn&#x2019;t make the same attempt. I don&#x2019;t think I have the hand-eye coordination. I don&#x2019;t think I have the judgment. I&#x2019;m not sure I could make it back on the road.</p><p>Then suddenly&#x2014;finally&#x2014;like the mile marker to heaven, I see the green sign for the cutoff to W. I don&#x2019;t even bother with the turn signal, just peel off from 159 with a faint whine of tires. There&#x2019;s hardly ever any traffic on W, which leads only to a few isolated homesteads like mine and huge tracts of undeveloped land offering a pretty equal mix of grass and trees. Of course, the isolation of the route is a mixed blessing on most days. The road is well behind on necessary maintenance, and the asphalt is an obstacle course of potholes, cracks, and failed repairs. I&#x2019;ve increased my speed as much as I can without running the risk of hurtling off the road, but every bump and fissure jars me against the seat belt and slams my head nauseatingly against my spine.</p><p>Nausea&#x2014;that&#x2019;s usually the last symptom. Five minutes or less by now. The September day is chilly, maybe fifty degrees, but I hit the controls so the four automatic windows roll all the way down. The only thing worse than transforming in a public place in the middle of the day would be transforming in a locked car with all the windows up. No way to get out. I try not to think about what will happen if I change into something too big to crawl out the window. That hasn&#x2019;t happened for a while now&#x2014;years, really. Even a deer, even a wolf, would be able to squeeze through a car&#x2019;s rolled-down window, wouldn&#x2019;t it? I&#x2019;ve never been a bear or a giraffe&#x2014;a moose only a couple of times&#x2014;and the elephant&#x2014;well, that&#x2019;s never happened again&#x2014;</p><p>My stomach clenches and I slap my hand across my mouth. I don&#x2019;t actually throw up, but I can feel the bile at the back of my throat. <i>Almost time, almost time. </i>I&#x2019;d love to get another mile down the road, but the trade-off isn&#x2019;t worth it. The blackness has started to build up at the corner of my vision, little lights are dancing through the pulsating <i>V</i>s of the visual migraine, and I&#x2019;m in so much physical pain that it&#x2019;s hard to tell what&#x2019;s slamming up from my backbone and what&#x2019;s jackhammering down from my skull. <i>Stop gambling, </i>I tell myself, and wrench the Jeep to the shoulder. It&#x2019;s really just a little strip of crumbling asphalt that drops into a low ditch of prickly weeds, but even a semi ought to be able to get past my vehicle without smashing it to pieces.</p><p>I leave everything in the front seat&#x2014;my phone, my purse, my clothes&#x2014;and exit through the passenger-side door. Immediately, I feel better. No matter what happens next, at least I won&#x2019;t be trapped. At least I&#x2019;ll be able to go crashing off into the undergrowth and look for some kind of cover until one of my friends comes to find me.</p><p>I&#x2019;m crouching barefoot on the side of the road, but the pain drives me all the way to my knees. I can feel the dry knife-edges of the weed leaves slicing at my bare toes and ankles; I can feel the broken stone of the asphalt digging into my calves. But I scarcely notice. The migraine has enveloped my whole body. It is cracking my skull in two, it is pummeling my stomach, and I am bent over so far that my nose rests between my knees. If I move a fraction of an inch in any direction, everything on my inside will spill out, in vomit, in blood, in viscous leaking fluids of mucus, saliva, and brains&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>One more powerful compression, as if a giant hand is squashing me from above with such force that I grunt involuntarily. And then it&#x2019;s all over.</p><p>The pressure, the pain, the nausea. Gone, evaporated. I feel light, almost weightless. I feel lithe and strong and absolutely <i>right</i>. My body has once again survived a violent passage and rebirth and delivered me to a shape that calls to it as seductively as its own.</p><p>For a moment, I just revel in the bliss of well-being, then I take a moment to determine what I am. I extend my left arm, to find it covered with fluffy marmalade fur; I&#x2019;ve unsheathed five impressively sharp claws, and a slinky tail wraps around from behind. A cat then&#x2014;housecat, probably. I don&#x2019;t feel large enough to be one of the bigger wild felines. I bunch myself up against the right front tire, but my arched back doesn&#x2019;t even clear the wheel well.</p><p>Good. A cat is the best I can hope for. Mobile, self-sufficient, commonplace. I could fend for myself for weeks if I had to, make my way to my property under my own power, and never raise the slightest bit of curiosity from any passersby I might encounter.</p><p>I wonder if this transformation is purely random or if my serums are actually taking effect. I have been trying&#x2014;with limited success&#x2014;to guide my body in the choices it makes, to channel it into more socially acceptable creatures when the imperative to change takes it over. I have, in fact, been injecting a specialized concoction for the past few weeks, hoping to become this very animal. Perhaps this is proof that I&#x2019;ve been successful&#x2014;to a point. Perhaps the early transformation came about because of that very concoction. Perhaps I have staved off one side effect only to incur another.</p><p>Worries for another day.</p><p>As always, once I enter animal state, I find it difficult to focus on the everyday, ordinary concerns that usually preoccupy my mind. I&#x2019;m still <i>me</i>, I have my own memories and my same powers of reasoning, but all the familiar obsessions seem distant and unimportant. New imperatives claim my attention&#x2014;usually, depending on the shape I&#x2019;ve taken, revolving around finding food and finding safety. I&#x2019;m easily distracted by scents, sounds, movements on the periphery. I&#x2019;m much more focused on the challenges of the immediate present.</p><p>Which, I have to confess, is sometimes a relief, considering how much my human brain usually frets over the unsolvable troubles of the future. Sometimes descending into the wild is like a brief vacation from my chaotic and all-too-demanding existence.</p><p>But right now I can&#x2019;t afford to give in to the cat&#x2019;s impulse to go stalking through the high grass toward the promising rustle of bird wings. I can&#x2019;t go chasing after butterflies and bees. I&#x2019;m still far from home, and someone should be on the way to get me. I need to be here and relatively alert whenever that someone arrives.</p><p>I face the car, bunch my muscles, and make a smooth leap through the open window on the passenger&#x2019;s side. I&#x2019;d forgotten about the purse and phone and clothes I&#x2019;d left on the seat, so I skid through them in a sloppy landing, then hop over the gear shift to the driver&#x2019;s side. The afternoon sunlight has painted a golden square on the fabric, and both the warmth and the color are inviting. I pat at the cloth with my left paw, find it suitable, then drop down into a contented curl, wrapping my tail around my head. A nap is the best way to pass the hours, stay out of trouble, and conserve my strength, all at the same time. I feel my narrow jaws open in a gigantic yawn, then I resettle my face against my paws. I am instantly in a light, untroubled sleep from which I know I can wake at a moment&#x2019;s notice.</p><p>Cats really do have the best lives. If I could choose, this is the shape I would always take.</p><p>No. If I could choose, I would always stay human.</p><p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p><p>I&#x2019;m not paying close attention, but I think it&#x2019;s about a half hour before I hear the sound of a car that doesn&#x2019;t just zoom past, but actually slows down then rumbles to a stop as it pulls over right in front of me on the shoulder. I instantly come awake and scramble up, setting my paws on the top of the steering wheel so I can peer out the windshield. Shapes and colors are weird, distorted, so I have to concentrate to pull out human memories to compare against the images I&#x2019;m seeing now. But I recognize the battered old station wagon even before the door swings open and the driver steps out.</p><p>Bonnie. My luck is in. By far the most reliable of my friends, she has not only shown up to rescue me, she has no doubt phoned everyone else in our circle to let them know their services aren&#x2019;t required&#x2014;hell, she probably picked up groceries, paid my electricity bill, and arranged to have Highway W resurfaced while she was at it.</p><p>She doesn&#x2019;t spot me right at first, so as soon as she slams her door, she stands beside the car for a moment, hands on her hips, and looks around, as if wondering where I&#x2019;ve gotten to. She&#x2019;s probably six feet tall, 140 pounds if she&#x2019;s just finished a big meal, angular, knobby, impatient, brilliant, and totally unaffected by anyone else&#x2019;s opinion. Her short, curly black hair is showing a few singular strands of gray, one of the few clues to the fact that she&#x2019;s just over sixty. Her eyes are dark brown and even when she&#x2019;s laughing, her expression is fierce. If she were a shape-shifter, which she&#x2019;s not, she&#x2019;d be a bird of prey, I&#x2019;ve always thought. Hawk. Falcon. Eagle. Something you wouldn&#x2019;t mess with. Something that rarely, if ever, failed.</p><p>I drop to all fours, gather my muscles, and leap through the open window to the street. The motion catches her attention and she sees me. Relief crosses her spare features as I trot over.</p><p>&#x201c;Karadel. Thank heavens,&#x201d; she says, bending down to pick me up. In human shape, I don&#x2019;t often seek out casual physical contact, but this particular body craves affection. I like how she cradles me against her thin chest; I respond with a low purr of contentment. She takes a moment to pet my head and scratch my chin, but Bonnie&#x2019;s not one for lingering on niceties, especially when there&#x2019;s work to be done.</p><p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s get you home,&#x201d; she says, opening her car door.</p><p>I prepare to jump inside, but my claws catch on Bonnie&#x2019;s arms to halt my forward motion when I real...</p></p><h2>Moon Utah: With Zion, Bryce Canyon, Arches, Capitol Reef &amp; Canyonlands National Parks (Travel Guide)</h2><p><b>From remote deserts and arid mountain ranges to colorful canyons and world-famous national parks, <i>Moon Utah</i> reveals the best of this adventurous state.

But on arrival in London, she learns that her errand is twofold: in addition to the vestments, she must convey a secret stash of gold from the sempster, a widow named Anne, to Frevisse's cousin, Lady Alice. Alice has more to hide than gold. She's having an affair with Daved, a Jewish merchant. Because Jews have been long expelled from England, Daved pretends to be Christian, while continuing to practice Judaism behind closed doors. Frevisse is drawn ever deeper into intrigue when she accompanies Anne to identify a body that some priests believe shows the marks of a Jewish ritual killing.

But after <i>Roe v. Wade, </i>their determination to develop a respectable, nonconfrontational movement encouraged many of them to use the word <i>choice--</i>an easier concept for people weary of various rights movements. At first the distinction in language didn't seem to make much difference-the law seemed to guarantee both. But in the years since, the change has become enormously important.<br><br>In <i>Beggars and Choosers, </i>Solinger shows how historical distinctions between women of color and white women, between poor and middle-class women, were used in new ways during the era of "choice." Politicians and policy makers began to exclude certain women from the class of "deserving mothers" by using the language of choice to create new public policies concerning everything from Medicaid funding for abortions to family tax credits, infertility treatments, international adoption, teen pregnancy, and welfare. Solinger argues that the class-and-race-inflected guarantee of "choice" is a shaky foundation on which to build our notions of reproductive freedom. Her impassioned argument is for reproductive rights as human rights--as a basis for full citizenship status for women. <br><br></p><p><i>Beggars and Choosers: How the Politics of Choice Shapes Adoption, Abortion, and Welfare in the United States</i> is a thorough feminist history of public policy on abortion since <i>Roe v. Wade</i>, as well as a reconsideration of recent political strategy. Rickie Solinger's third book on reproductive rights hinges on a crucial semantic shift in the 1970s from "abortion rights" to the softer, less direct "choice" and "pro-choice," itself an attempt to shake off the awkward "pro-abortion" tag. While "rights" are undeniable, Solinger asserts, "choice" is a market-driven concept. "Historical distinctions between women of color and white women, between poor and middle-class women, have been reproduced and institutionalized in the "era of choice," she continues, "in part by defining some groups of women as good choice makers, some as bad." <p> Solinger also advances a troubling economic thesis about adoption, defined roughly as "the transfer of babies from women of one social classification to women in a higher social classification or group." Bracing and well-researched, Solinger's arguments should be considered by anyone working for women's and children's rights. <i>--Regina Marler</i></p><br><b>Rickie Solinger</b>, a historian and writer, is the author of three other books about reproductive rights: <i>Wake Up Little Susie, Abortion Wars</i>, and <i>The Abortionist</i>.

James fuses her lifelong passion for the work of Jane Austen with her own great talent for writing crime fiction.<br><br>The year is 1803, and Darcy and Elizabeth have been married for six years. There are now two handsome, healthy sons in the Pemberley nursery, Elizabeth's beloved sister Jane and her husband, Bingley, live within seventeen miles, the ordered and secure life of Pemberley seems unassailable, and Elizabeth's happiness in her marriage is complete. But their peace is threatened and old sins and misunderstandings are rekindled on the eve of the annual autumn ball. The Darcys and their guests are preparing to retire for the night when a chaise appears, rocking down the path from Pemberley's wild woodland, and as it pulls up, Lydia Wickham, an uninvited guest, tumbles out, screaming that her husband has been murdered.<br><br><b>Death Comes to Pemberley</b> is a powerful work of fiction, as rich in its compelling story, in its evocation of place, and its gripping psychological and emotional insight, as the very best of P.

I quit such odious subjects as soon as I can, impatient to restore everybody not greatly in fault themselves to tolerable comfort, and to have done with all the rest.&#x201d; No doubt she would have replied to my apology by saying that, had she wished to dwell on such odious subjects, she would have written this story herself, and done it better.<br><br>P. D. James, 2011<br><br>PROLOGUE<br><i><br>The Bennets of Longbourn</i><br><br>It was generally agreed by the female residents of Meryton that Mr. and Mrs. Bennet of Longbourn had been fortunate in the disposal in marriage of four of their fi ve daughters. Meryton, a small market town in Hertfordshire, is not on the route of any tours of pleasure, having neither beauty of setting nor a distinguished history, while its only great house, Netherfi eld Park, although impressive, is not mentioned in books about the county&#x2019;s notable architecture. The town has an assembly room where dances are regularly held but no theatre, and the chief entertainment takes place in private houses where the boredom of dinner parties and whist tables, always with the same company, is relieved by gossip.<br><br>A family of five unmarried daughters is sure of attracting the sympathetic concern of all their neighbours, particularly where other diversions are few, and the situation of the Bennets was especially unfortunate. In the absence of a male heir, Mr. Bennet&#x2019;s estate was entailed on his nephew, the Reverend William Collins, who, as Mrs. Bennet was fond of loudly lamenting, could turn her and her daughters out of the house before her husband was cold in his grave. Admittedly, Mr. Collins had attempted to make such redress as lay in his power. At some inconvenience to himself, but with the approval of his formidable patroness Lady Catherine de Bourgh, he had left his parish at Hunsford in Kent to visit the Bennets with the charitable intention of selecting a bride from the fi ve daughters. This intention was received by Mrs. Bennet with enthusiastic approval but she warned him that Miss Bennet, the eldest, was likely to be shortly engaged. His choice of Elizabeth, the second in seniority and beauty, had met with a resolute rejection and he had been obliged to seek a more sympathetic response to his pleading from Elizabeth&#x2019;s friend Miss Charlotte Lucas. Miss Lucas had accepted his proposal with gratifying alacrity and the future which Mrs. Bennet and her daughters could expect was settled, not altogether to the general regret of their neighbours. On Mr. Bennet&#x2019;s death, Mr. Collins would install them in one of the larger cottages on the estate where they would receive spiritual comfort from his administrations and bodily sustenance from the leftovers from Mrs. Collins&#x2019;s kitchen augmented by the occasional gift of game or a side of bacon.<br><br>But from these benefi ts the Bennet family had a fortunate escape. By the end of 1799 Mrs. Bennet could congratulate herself on being the mother of four married daughters. Admittedly the marriage of Lydia, the youngest, aged only sixteen, was not propitious. She had eloped with Lieutenant George Wickham, an offi cer in the militia which had been stationed at Meryton, an escapade which was confidently expected to end, as all such adventures deserve, in her desertion by Wickham, banishment from her home, rejection from society and the fi nal degradation which decency forbade the ladies to mention. The marriage had, however, taken place, the first news being brought by a neighbour, William Goulding, when he rode past the Longbourn coach and the newly married Mrs. Wickham placed her hand on the open window so that he could see the ring. Mrs. Bennet&#x2019;s sister, Mrs. Philips, was assiduous in circulating her version of the elopement, that the couple had been on their way to Gretna Green but had made a short stop in London to enable Wickham to inform a godmother of his forthcoming nuptials, and, on the arrival of Mr. Bennet in search of his daughter, the couple had accepted the family&#x2019;s suggestion that the intended marriage could more conveniently take place in London. No one believed this fabrication, but it was acknowledged that Mrs. Philips&#x2019;s ingenuity in devising it deserved at least a show of credulity. George Wickham, of course, could never be accepted in Meryton again to rob the female servants of their virtue and the shopkeepers of their profit, but it was agreed that, should his wife come among them, Mrs. Wickham should be afforded the tolerant forbearance previously accorded to Miss Lydia Bennet.<br><br>There was much speculation about how the belated marriage had been achieved. Mr. Bennet&#x2019;s estate was hardly worth two thousand pounds a year, and it was commonly felt that Mr. Wickham would have held out for at least fi ve hundred and all his Meryton and other bills being paid before consenting to the marriage. Mrs. Bennet&#x2019;s brother, Mr. Gardiner, must have come up with the money. He was known to be a warm man, but he had a family and no doubt would expect repayment from Mr. Bennet. There was considerable anxiety in Lucas Lodge that their son- in- law&#x2019;s inheritance might be much diminished by this necessity, but when no trees were felled, no land sold, no servants put off and the butcher showed no disinclination to provide Mrs. Bennet with her customary weekly order, it was assumed that Mr. Collins and dear Charlotte had nothing to fear and that, as soon as Mr. Bennet was decently buried, Mr. Collins could take possession of the Longbourn estate with every confidence that it had remained intact.<br><br>But the engagement which followed shortly after Lydia&#x2019;s marriage, that of Miss Bennet and Mr. Bingley of Netherfi eld Park, was received with approbation. It was hardly unexpected; Mr. Bingley&#x2019;s admiration for Jane had been apparent from their fi rst meeting at an assembly ball. Miss Bennet&#x2019;s beauty, gentleness and the naive optimism about human nature which inclined her never to speak ill of anyone made her a general favourite. But within days of the engagement of her eldest to Mr. Bingley being announced, an even greater triumph for Mrs. Bennet was noised abroad and was at first received with incredulity. Miss Elizabeth Bennet, the second daughter, was to marry Mr. Darcy, the owner of Pemberley, one of the greatest houses in Derbyshire and, it was rumoured, with an income of ten thousand pounds a year.<br><br>It was common knowledge in Meryton that Miss Lizzy hated Mr. Darcy, an emotion in general held by those ladies and gentlemen who had attended the first assembly ball at which Mr. Darcy had been present with Mr. Bingley and his two sisters, and at which he had given adequate evidence of his pride and arrogant disdain of the company, making it clear, despite the prompting of his friend<br>Mr. Bingley, that no woman present was worthy to be his partner. Indeed, when Sir William Lucas had introduced Elizabeth to him,<br>Mr. Darcy had declined to dance with her, later telling Mr. Bingley that she was not pretty enough to tempt him. It was taken for granted that no woman could be happy as Mrs. Darcy for, as Maria Lucas pointed out, &#x201c;Who would want to have that disagreeable face opposite you at the breakfast table for the rest of your life?&#x201d;<br><br>But there was no cause to blame Miss Elizabeth Bennet for taking a more prudent and optimistic view. One cannot have everything in life and any young lady in Meryton would have endured more than a disagreeable face at the breakfast table to marry ten thousand a year and to be mistress of Pemberley. The ladies of Meryton, as in duty bound, were happy to sympathise with the afflicted and to congratulate the fortunate but there should be moderation in all things, and Miss Elizabeth&#x2019;s triumph was on much too grand a scale. Although they conceded that she was pretty enough and had fine eyes, she had nothing else to recommend her to a man with ten thousand a year and it was not long before a coterie of the most influential gossips concocted an explanation: Miss Lizzy had been determined to capture Mr. Darcy from the moment of their first meeting. And when the extent of her strategy had become apparent it was agreed that she had played her cards skilfully from the very beginning. Although Mr. Darcy had declined to dance with her at the assembly ball, his eyes had been frequently on her and her friend Charlotte who, after years of husband-seeking, was extremely adroit at identifying any sign of a possible attachment, and had warned Elizabeth against allowing her obvious partiality for the attractive and popular Lieutenant George Wickham to cause her to offend a man of ten times his consequence.<br><br>And then there was the incident of Miss Bennet&#x2019;s dinner engagement at Netherfield when, due to her mother&#x2019;s insistence on her riding rather than taking the family coach, Jane had caught a very convenient cold and, as Mrs. Bennet had planned, was forced to stay for several nights at Netherfi eld. Elizabeth, of course, had set out on foot to visit her, and Miss Bingley&#x2019;s good manners had impelled her to offer hospitality to the unwelcome visitor until Miss Bennet recovered. Nearly a week spent in the company of Mr. Darcy must have enhanced Elizabeth&#x2019;s hopes of success and she would have made the best of this enforced intimacy.<br><br>Subsequently, at the urging of the youngest Bennet girls, Mr. Bingley had himself held a ball at Netherfi eld, and on this occasion Mr. Darcy had indeed danced with Elizabeth. The chaperones, ranged in their chairs against the wall, had raised their lorgnettes and, like the rest of the company, studied the pair carefully as they made their way down the line. Certainly there had been little conversation between them but the very fact that Mr. Darcy had actually asked Miss Elizabeth to dance and had not been refused was a matter for interest and speculation.<br><br>The next stage in Elizabeth&#x2019;s campaign was her visit, with Sir William Lucas and his daughter Maria, to Mr. and Mrs. Collins at Hunsford Parsonage. Normally this was surely an invitation which Miss Lizzy should have refused. What possible pleasure could any rational woman take in six weeks of Mr. Collins&#x2019;s company? It was generally known that, before his acceptance by Miss Lucas, Miss Lizzy had been his fi rst choice of bride. Delicacy, apart from any other consideration, should have kept her away from Hunsford. But she had, of course, been aware that Lady Catherine de Bourgh was Mr. Collins&#x2019;s neighbour and patroness, and that her nephew, Mr. Darcy, would almost certainly be at Rosings while the visitors were at the parsonage. Charlotte, who kept her mother informed of every detail of her married life, including the health of her cows, poultry and husband, had written subsequently to say that Mr. Darcy and his cousin, Colonel Fitzwilliam, who was also visiting Rosings, had called at the parsonage frequently during Elizabeth&#x2019;s stay and that Mr. Darcy on one occasion had visited without his cousin when Elizabeth had been on her own. Mrs. Collins was certain that this distinction must confirm that he was falling in love and wrote that, in her opinion, her friend would have taken either gentleman with alacrity had an offer been made; Miss Lizzy had however returned home with nothing settled.<br><br>But at last all had come right when Mrs. Gardiner and her husband, who was Mrs. Bennet&#x2019;s brother, had invited Elizabeth to accompany them on a summer tour of pleasure. It was to have been as far as the Lakes, but Mr. Gardiner&#x2019;s business responsibilities had apparently dictated a more limited scheme and they would go no further north than Derbyshire. It was Kitty, the fourth Bennet daughter, who had conveyed this news, but no one in Meryton believed the excuse. A wealthy family who could afford to travel from London to Derbyshire could clearly extend the tour to the Lakes had they wished. It was obvious that Mrs. Gardiner, a partner<br>in her favourite niece&#x2019;s matrimonial scheme, had chosen Derbyshire because Mr. Darcy would be at Pemberley, and indeed the Gardiners and Elizabeth, who had no doubt enquired at the inn when the master of Pemberley would be at home, were actually visiting the house when Mr. Darcy returned. Naturally, as a matter of courtesy, the Gardiners were introduced and the party invited to dine at Pemberley, and if Miss Elizabeth had entertained any doubts about the wisdom of her scheme to secure Mr. Darcy, the first sight of Pemberley had confirmed her determination to fall in love with him at the first convenient moment. Subsequently he and his friend Mr. Bingley had returned to Netherfi eld Park and had lost no time in calling at Longbourn where the happiness of Miss Bennet and Miss Elizabeth was finally and triumphantly secured. The engagement, despite its brilliance, gave less pleasure than had Jane&#x2019;s. Elizabeth had never been popular, indeed the more perceptive of the Meryton ladies occasionally suspected that Miss Lizzy was privately laughing at them. They also accused her of being sardonic, and although there was uncertainty about the meaning of the word, they knew that it was not a desirable quality in a woman, being one which gentlemen particularly disliked. Neighbours whose jealousy of such a triumph exceeded any satisfaction in the prospect of the union were able to console themselves by averring that Mr. Darcy&#x2019;s pride and arrogance and his wife&#x2019;s caustic wit would ensure that they lived together in the utmost misery for which even Pemberley and ten thousand a year could offer no consolation.<br><br>Allowing for such formalities without which grand nuptials could hardly be valid, the taking of likenesses, the busyness of lawyers, the buying of new carriages and wedding clothes, the marriage of Miss Bennet to Mr. Bingley and Miss Elizabeth to Mr. Darcy took place on the same day at Longbourn church with surprisingly little delay. It would have been the happiest day of Mrs. Bennet&#x2019;s life had she not been seized with palpitations during the service, brought on by fear that Mr. Darcy&#x2019;s formidable aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, might appear in the church door to forbid the marriage, and it was not until after the final blessing that she could feel secure in her triumph.<br><br>It is doubtful whether Mrs. Bennet missed the company of her second daughter, but her husband certainly did. Elizabeth had<br>always been his favourite child. She had inherited his intelligence, something of his sharp wit, and his pleasure in the foibles and inconsistencies of their neighbours, and Longbourn House was a lonelier and less rational place without her company. Mr. Bennet was a clever and reading man whose library was both a refuge and the source of his happiest hours. He and Darcy rapidly came to the conclusion that they liked each other and thereafter, as is common with friends, accepted their different quirks of character as evidence of the other&#x2019;s superior intellect. Mr. Bennet&#x2019;s visits to Pemberley, frequently made when he was least expected, were chiefly spent in the library, one of the fi nest in private hands, from which it was difficult to extract him, even for meals. He visited the Bingleys at Highmarten less frequently since, apart from Jane&#x2019;s excessive preoccupation with the comfort and well- being of her husband and children, which occasionally Mr. Bennet found irksome, there were few new books and periodicals to tempt him. Mr. Bingley&#x2019;s money had originally come from trade. He had inherited no family library and had only thought of setting one up after his purchase of Highmarten House. In this project both Darcy and Mr. Bennet were very ready to assist. There are few activities so agreeable as spending a friend&#x2019;s money to your ow...</p><h2>Show of Evil</h2><p>"Spine-tingling" said the New York Times of William Diehl's Primal Fear, the national bestseller about brilliant defense attorney Martin Vail and the psychotic murderer he saves from execution. Now, in Diehl's spellbinding new novel, Vail has become Chicago's chief prosecutor, the man with the power to tear down enemies in high places. But he must also confront his worst legal nightmare--a nightmare that he, himself, helped to create.<br>It begins with a shocking, unsolved murder: a young mother named Linda Balfour is butchered in a small town in southern Illinois, and no one can turn up a single lead. But then, months later, a tiny crack opens up in the case. By a stroke of pure chance, an investigator in the Chicago D.A.'s office discovers that Linda Balfour died with a coded inscription printed in blood on the back of her head. It is the exact combination of letters and numbers that was found on the head of Bishop Rushman, the beloved Chicago clergyman who had been slashed and dismembered years before by an angelic-looking altar boy named Aaron Stampler. The same Aaron Stampler whom Vail saved from the electric chair.<br>For the past ten years, Stampler has been locked away in a high security institution for the criminally insane, with no access to the outside world. So how could he have killed Linda Belfour? And then another altar boy turns up dead--with a similar inscription in blood on the back of his head.<br>If Aaron Stampler isn't committing these killings, who is? Martin Vail's career--maybe even his life--hangs in the balance....<br>In one bestseller after another, William Diehl has dazzled readers and critics with his riveting plots. But nothing Diehl has written before will prepare his fans for the explosive suspense of Show of Evil. Filled with unforgettable characters, crackling with the energy and hustle of Chicago, shocking in its insights into the mind of a psychotic killer, Show of Evil is Diehl at the peak of his powers.</p><p>I rediscovered William Diehl when I was interviewing for an editorial position here at Ballantine. In researching Ballantine authors, I came across the book 'Primal Fear'. While I had loved the movie, I had not read the book and had no idea that there were two sequels ('Show of Evil' and 'Reign in Hell') featuring the enigmatic Aaron Stampler and Martin Vail characters. I bought all three books on the spot and spent a wonderful weekend immersed in the cat and mouse game between attorney and killer. After completing the trilogy, I fell in love with Bill Diehl on the spot---my only disappointment was in discovering that he wasn't planning on any future novels featuring Vail (who he had actually killed off in his original draft of 'Reign in Hell'). <br><br>By reading all three of the books within a short period, I was able to see the metamorphosis of the characters over their lifespan: The maturation of Vail as he moved from the role of defense attorney, to prosecutor, and finally to Attorney General; and the increasingly cunning psychosis of Stampler, who evolved from an angry youth guilty of a vengeful murder into a revolutionary zealot with the lives of hundreds in his hands. <br><br>Unlike a lot of sequels that just rehash a similar series of events with a few minute changes, this one takes all of your assumptions and turns them upside down, resulting in a completely unexpected read.It begins with a shocking, unsolved murder. In a small town in southern Illinois, the butchered body of Linda Balfour -- with a cryptic code printed in blood on the back of her head -- forges a gruesome link to the brutal murder of Bishop Rushman, the beloved Chicago clergyman who had been dismembered years before by the angelic-looking altar boy, Aaron Stampler. The same Aaron Stampler whom defense attorney Martin Vail saved from the electric chair....<p>Now Vail is Chicago's chief prosecutor, facing the nightmare of his life. If Stampler has been locked away in a high-security institution for the past ten years, how could he have killed Linda Balfour? Then another altar boy turns up dead with a similar inscription in blood on the back of his head. If Aaron Stampler isn't committing these killings, who is? Martin Vail's career -- maybe even his life -- hangs on the answer....</p></p><h2>Smoke Screen</h2><p>Through a series of unwanted promotions, Trevor Barnett has become the lead spokesman for the tobacco industry-just as a two-hundred-billion-dollar lawsuit is about to bankrupt it. Now, Big Tobacco is going on the offensive-and Trevor is caught in the crossfire.</p><p>Kyle Mills lives in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, where he spends his time skiing, rock climbing and writing books.With this sixth novel in as many years (following last year's Sphere of Influence), Mills departs from his usual suspense thriller format of mass murder, conspiracy and terrorist threat. What he presents instead is a timely and chilling tale hinging on the power of Big Tobacco to bring the American government and economy to a standstill. Trevor Barnett, 32, is heir to a giant tobacco conglomerate called Terra. He is also a lazy ne'er-do-well who works for the company only because his trust payments are tied to his employment in the tobacco industry. He knows cigarette smoking kills people, but doesn't really care, believing that smokers have the right to make their own decisions. The tobacco industry is about to lose a $250-billion class-action lawsuit, a judgment the industry cannot appeal. Such a ruling will permanently bankrupt all of the tobacco companies, and Terra's ruthless CEO, Paul Trainer, is not about to let that happen. After making some snappy and irreverent comments at a board meeting, Trevor suddenly and unwillingly finds himself spearheading a tobacco offensive that shakes the nation. Big Tobacco closes all its plants and recalls all its tobacco products in a clever game of chicken, facing down the courts, Congress, the White House and the antismoking lobby. The result is a catastrophic loss of tax revenue and political donations, and an angry population of smoking voters who want their cigarettes back. The novel's plot is carefully crafted and original, filled with corporate and political intrigue, treachery, betrayal and the complex backroom deals that keep big companies humming along. With a refreshing lack of sanctimony, Mills turns the tobacco wars into grist for an absorbing business thriller. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Unexpected Night (Otto Penzler&#39;s Classic American Mystery Library)</h2><p>The discovery of young Amberly Cowden&#39;s body at the base of a cliff, as well as the strange events apparently related to the impoverished acting troupe at the Cove, disrupt Gamage&#39;s restful golf retreat.

Whether they're skewering past administrations or present, the fun and melodious Steps bring laughter as they bid George W. to "Don't Go Pretending You're Smart" (to the tune of "Don't Go Breaking My Heart") and "Stand by Your Dan," sung by Mrs. Quayle to the tune of Tammy Wynette's classic.

Grace wrote over&nbsp;one hundred faith-inspired books during her lifetime. When her first husband died, leaving her with two daughters to raise, writing became a way to make a living, but she always recognized storytelling as a way to share her faith in God. She has touched countless lives through the years and continues to touch lives today. Her books feature moving stories, delightful characters, and love in its purest form.&nbsp;Grace Livingston Hill began writing stories in 1877 at the tender age of twelve and didn&#x2019;t stop until her death in 1947.

Falling for a client&#39;s sob story had pushed him into telling a little white lie . . . and cost him a year&#39;s suspension. Now he&#39;s back in the courtroom with not one, but two clients accused of murder. The rich, gorgeous owner of a topless bar is guilty as sin . . . and he&#39;s going to make a bundle fighting to get her off. The poor Mexican laborer is innocent and will probably get the death penalty . . . unless Blackburn risks everything--his career, his wife, and even his life--for justice. Real justice.The courtroom scenes are breathtaking in Irving's ( The Angel of Zin ) new novel. Warren Blackburn practices criminal law in Houston, in the same Harris County courthouse where his late father was a respected judge. When he executes a perjurious affidavit on behalf of a client whom he foolishly trusted, Warren is suspended from practice for a year. Upon his return, he is relegated to the detritus of criminal defense work, until he suddenly becomes counsel to two defendants in murder cases, one celebrated. Warren discovers that one of his clients was likely the actual murderer in the other case, but lawyer-client confidentiality prevents disclosure, and he is trapped in a Kafkaesque dilemma. Although the plot holds few surprises, Irving's development of the trial-related issues is masterful, providing gripping suspense. Similarly, while some of the extralegal parts of the narrative (Blackburn's marital problems, his predictable affair with a court stenographer) are rather contrived, the court proceedings, strategy and testimony are authentic and first-rate; and the cross-examination of the one pivotal "eyewitness" is riveting. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Rooftops of Tehran</h2><p><b>From �&#x201c;a striking new talent�&#x201d;(Sandra Dallas, author of <i>Tallgrass</i>) comes an unforgettable debut novel of young love and coming of age in an Iran headed toward revolution.</b><br><br> In this poignant, eye-opening and emotionally vivid novel, Mahbod Seraji lays bare the beauty and brutality of the centuries-old Persian culture, while reaffirming the human experiences we all share.<br><br> In a middle-class neighborhood of Iran�&#x2019;s sprawling capital city, 17-year-old Pasha Shahed spends the summer of 1973 on his rooftop with his best friend Ahmed, joking around one minute and asking burning questions about life the next.

Wilfred Owen with his flaring genius; the intense, compassionate Siegfried Sassoon; the composer Ivor Gurney; Robert Graves, who would later spurn his war poems; the nature-loving Edward Thomas; the glamorous Fabian Socialist Rupert Brooke; and the shell-shocked Robert Nichols&#x2015;all fought in the war, and their poetry is a bold act of creativity in the face of unprecedented destruction.<br> <i>Some Desperate Glory </i>includes a chronological anthology of the poets' works, telling the story of the war not only through the lives of these writers but also through their art.

Brigitte Bardot is a style icon whose legacy has undeniably shaped the face of fashion as we know it. She was discovered by a magazine editor at only 14 years old, her career blossomed as the world emerged from the ashes of World War II. She found fame and admiration on the big screen in the 1950s and then became the fiery sex symbol of the groovy and liberated 1960s. Over the course of her career, all of the great French designers&#x2014;including Christian Dior, Pierre Balmain, and Pierre Cardin&#x2014;outfitted Bardot on- and offscreen. In photographs that capture her attending receptions by Queen Elizabeth II and Charles de Gaulle or on glamorous visits to the United States, in fashion shoots and on film sets, or relaxing on a grassy field, this volume illustrates all the key looks that BB wore and brought to the international spotlight as she invented and edited her own highly imitated style. In an extensive&#x2014;and extremely rare&#x2014;interview, accompanied by her personal comments on the photographs, Bardot explains the context of the often vanguard fashions she wore, making headlines wherever she went. Evoking French style and the glamour of St. Tropez, her legacy endures&#x2014;from ballerina slippers with sweeping skirts to figure-hugging knitwear, gingham fabrics and gypsy dresses, kohl eyeliner and tousled hair.</p><p><b>Henry-Jean Servat</b> has written extensively about Brigitte Bardot for <i>Paris Match</i> and <i>Vanity Fair</i>.

Whiteside presents the political theory of Maurice Merleau-Ponty (1908-1961), one of France's best-known twentieth-century philosophers. Whiteside argues that Merleau-Ponty's objective in his political writings was to make existentialism into the foundation for a philosophically consistent mode of political thinking. This study discusses the inadequacies Merleau-Ponty found in the traditional philosophies of empiricism and idealism, and then examines the subject-object dualism that he believed deprived previous forms of existentialism of political significance.</p><p>Whiteside shows how Merleau-Ponty overcame these problems by grounding political reasoning in a theory of consciousness that emphasized both its individuality and its need for socially created meaning. After explaining Merleau-Ponty's modifications of the views of Sartre, Aron, and others, the book investigates how he applied his political theory in editorial exchanges with Communists and liberals. Throughout this study, Whiteside traces and criticizes the changes in the philosopher's concept of Marxism and points to his many ideas that bear on current controversies in political theory.</p><p>Originally published in 1988.</p><p>The <b>Princeton Legacy Library</b> uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press.

With one gesture, the man later hailed as Charlemagne claimed his empire and forever shaped the destiny of Europe. <em>Becoming Charlemagne</em> tells the story of the international power struggle that led to this world-changing event.</p><p>Illuminating an era that has long been overshadowed by legend, this far-ranging book shows how the Frankish king and his wise counselors built an empire not only through warfare but also by careful diplomacy. With consummate political skill, Charlemagne partnered with a scandal-ridden pope, fended off a ruthless Byzantine empress, nurtured Jewish communities in his empire, and fostered ties with a famous Islamic caliph. For 1,200 years, the deeds of Charlemagne captured the imagination of his descendants, inspiring kings and crusaders, the conquests of Napoleon and Hitler, and the optimistic architects of the European Union.</p><p>In this engaging narrative, Jeff Sypeck crafts a vivid portrait of Karl, the ruler who became a legend, while transporting readers far beyond Europe to the glittering palaces of Constantinople and the streets of medieval Baghdad.

It describes a journey which begins in Cornwall and continues through Wales and Ireland, then across to Scotland and eventually down to London and southern Britain. The Romans have left, and the islands are now fought over by Irish, British Celts, Picts and Saxons. It is a dangerous world, full of tribal war. The British Celts are enthusiastic head-hunters, while the Saxon gods require regular blood sacrifices, animal and sometimes human. There are social pitfals too ( Do not make fun of the Celts&#39; beliefs about Arthur&#39;...The traveller must not fall asleep while a saga poem is being recited&#39;...&#39;Don&#39;t refuse a place in a Welsh collective bed&#39;) Cheviot bandits, bizarre forms of Christianity, boat burials, peculiar haircuts, human sacrifice, poetry competitions, slave markets, the legend of King Arthur - these are the realities of life in the sixth century AD.</p><p>Simon Young was awarded a starred First in Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic from Cambridge University, as well as the Chadwick Prize for Celtic studies.

DOWNSTAIRS, it was a hive of domestic activity, supported by a body of staff painstakingly devoted to ensuring the smooth running of the household. Brimming with family secrets, society scandal, and of course elaborate parties, dresses, and social customs, the world of an aristocratic Edwardian household as depicted on the hit show Downton Abbey has captivated millions. But what was life really like for the people who kept such a household running: the servants? In Life Below Stairs, international bestselling author Alison Maloney takes readers behind the scenes to reveal a lively and colorful picture of what went on &#34;downstairs,&#34; describing servants&#39; daily life in this now-vanished world. Detailing everything from household structure, pay and conditions, special duties, and rules and regulations, to perks, entertainment, and even romance, Maloney examines the drudgery and hardships below stairs, as well as the rewards and pleasures. Thoroughly researched and reliably informed, this charmingly illustrated volume also contains first-hand stories from the staff of the time, making it a must-read for anyone interested in the lifestyle and conduct of a bygone era.</p><p>ALISON MALONEY is a journalist and author, whose books include the international bestseller <i>The Mum's Book</i>. As well as a long stint on <i>The Sunday Post</i> newspaper, she worked as a children's book editor for two years. Alison lives in Kent, UK, with her husband and two children.Capitalizing on the popularity of Downton Abbey and the revival of Upstairs Downstairs, social historians have rushed to take a new look at the everyday lives of Victorian and Edwardian servants. Maloney casts a journalist&#x2019;s eye on an old subject, weighing in with this slim volume detailing the daily grind without benefit of the glamour and the intrigue that has hooked millions of viewers on these highbrow soap operas. Although not much new information is provided, this handy compendium is a digestible introduction to the dos and don&#x2019;ts of the highly stratified upper-class households of the era. Especially revealing are the interspersed anecdotal snippets culled from the memoirs of both domestic staff members and their well-heeled employers. --Margaret Flanagan</p><h2>JACK LONDON: Sailor on Horseback</h2><p>London&#39;s domestic life and literary endeavors are intertwined in this dramatic account of his career</p><p></p><h2>The Master of Hestviken</h2><p>Insight into the medieval man is given in this novel about the adventures of Olav Audunsson in thirteenth-century Norway</p><p></p><h2>Real Worship: It Will Transform Your Life/With Study Guide in Book</h2><p>This is one of those books which keeps on giving. By that I mean, out of shear excitement, I can&#39;t keep from loaning it out; and, likewise excited, the loanee can&#39;t seem to send it back home. I&#39;m on my third copy as of writing this review (and there will be more gifts given after Amazon.com sends me another batch). That&#39;s OK by me; the more people that internalize this book, the better able the church will be to perform its chief end of worshipping God and enjoying Him forever. Warren Wiersbe has the Biblical grounding and knowledge of Church history and tradition to comprehensively explore this subject. Best of all, he seems to have the personal experience in worship to truly know whereof he speaks. As he would doubtless say (see chapter 11), the writing of this book constituted an act of worship and was obviously addressed with appropriate effort and fervor. The very reading of Real Worship induces one to put down the book in mid-page, contemplate the glory of God and, yes, to engage in impromptu praise and worship.

He was drawn to painting as a child, inspired by his grandmother, a painter herself. She spent hours showing Joel the paintings of Matisse, Picasso, Mir�, and many others. Through these and her own paintings, she taught him ideas about color and design and eventually coached him on his earliest paintings. These childhood experiences lead him to pursue a B.A. in Fine Art and Philosophy. Becoming a parent was, for Joel, another way of looking at art in the world. As a young child himself, he made many of his own toys. As a father, he began making toys for his young twins. He began to see that a beautiful, minimal, well-crafted object allowed his children to use and develop their own imaginations, rather than having an object tell them how they must play with it. Moved by his children&#39;s interaction with art, Joel began documenting these crafts on his blog, Made By Joel. Creating art for children, and for the child in everyone, is a powerful thing. Joel lives with his wife and three-year-old twins in Portland, Oregon.

Avoiding Foucault's philosophical paradigm of dominance/submission, Claude Calame uses an anthropological and linguistic approach to re-create indigenous categories of erotic love. He maintains that Eros, the joyful companion of Aphrodite, was a divine figure around which poets constructed a physiology of desire that functioned in specific ways within a network of social relations. Calame begins by showing how poetry and iconography gave a rich variety of expression to the concept of Eros, then delivers a history of the deity's roles within social and political institutions, and concludes with a discussion of an Eros-centered metaphysics.</p><br><p> Calame's treatment of archaic and classical Greek institutions reveals Eros at work in initiation rites and celebrations, educational practices, the Dionysiac theater of tragedy and comedy, and in real and imagined spatial settings. For men, Eros functioned particularly in the symposium and the gymnasium, places where men and boys interacted and where future citizens were educated. The household was the setting where girls, brides, and adult wives learned their erotic roles--as such it provides the context for understanding female rites of passage and the problematics of sexuality in conjugal relations. Through analyses of both Greek language and practices, Calame offers a fresh, subtle reading of relations between individuals as well as a quick-paced and fascinating overview of Eros in Greek society at large.</p></p><p><b>Claude Calame</b> is Professor of Greek Language and Literature at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland.

George, the protagonist, is adjusting to life on his own after the sudden death of his partner, and determines to persist in the routines of his daily life: the course of A Single Man spans twenty-four hours in an ordinary day. An Englishman and a professor living in suburban Southern California, he is an outsider in every way, and his internal reflections and interactions with others reveal a man who loves being alive despite everyday injustices and loneliness. Wry, suddenly manic, constantly funny, surprisingly sad, this novel catches the texture of life itself.</p><p>Christopher Isherwood was born in 1904. He began to write at university and later moved to Berlin, where he gave English lessons to support himself. He witnessed first hand the rise to power of Hitler and the Nazi party in Germany and some of his best works, such as Mr. Norris Changes Trains and Goodbye to Berlin, draw on these experiences. He created the character of Sally Bowles, later made famous as the heroine of the musical Cabaret. Isherwood travelled with W.H Auden to China in the late 1930s before going with him to America in 1939. He died on 4 January 1986.Isherwood's resurrected classic&#x2014;now a feature film&#x2014;takes us to Southern California in the 1960s and into one day in the life of George, a gay, middle-aged English professor, struggling to cope with his young lover's tragic death. Simon Prebble's voice is a perfect conduit for Isherwood's lyricism, and he assumes the role of George so naturally and with such raw feeling that listeners will feel as if they are hearing the words straight from the protagonist himself, so beautifully does Prebble create George's reserve behind which surge tides of grief, rage, and bitter loneliness. <i>A University of Minnesota paperback.

This definitive study takes readers into the cockpits and onto the flight decks of the versatile and hardy U.S. escort carriers (CVEs) to tell of their vital, yet little-known contribution to the anti-U-boat campaign. Sailing apart from the Allied convoys, the CVE captains had complete freedom of action and frequently took their ships on &#34;hunt and kill&#34; missions against the enemy. The German submarines were allowed no respite and no place to relax without the fear of discovery. In the eighteen months between the spring of 1943, when the escort carriers began to prowl the Atlantic to November of 1944, the average number of U-boats in daily operation was reduced from 108 to a mere 31. Written by World War II historian William Y&#39;Blood, the book includes a discussion on the CVE&#39;s development and construction as well as an examination of the ship&#39;s tactical and strategic uses. Though land-based aircraft, various support groups, and the convoy system itself helped win the Battle of the Atlantic, the author shows beyond a doubt that the escort carriers groups&#39; influence was profound and notable.</p><p>William T. Y&#39;Blood, a pilot in the U.S. Air Force and later in commercial aviation, served as a historian for the Air Force.

The saints counted most prominently as potential intercessors before God, but the ordinary dead as well were called upon to aid the living, and even to participate in the negotiation of political disputes. In this book, the distinguished medievalist Patrick J. Geary shows how exploring the complex relations between the living and dead can broaden our understanding of the political, economic, and cultural history of medieval Europe. Geary has brought together for this volume twelve of his most influential essays. They address such topics as the development of saints' cults and of the concept of sacred space; the integration of saints' cults into the lives of ordinary people; patterns of relic circulation; and the role of the dead in negotiating the claims and counterclaims of various interest groups. Also included are two case studies of communities that enlisted new patron saints to solve their problems. Throughout, Geary demonstrates that, by reading actions, artifacts, and rituals on an equal footing with texts, we can better grasp the otherness of past societies.</p></p><p><p>Patrick J. Geary is Professor of History and Director of the Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies, University of California, Los Angeles. Among his books are <i>Furta Sacra: Thefts of Relics in the Central Middle Ages; Aristocracy in Provence; </i>and<i> Before France and Germany.</i></p></p><h2>The American Prophecies: Ancient Scriptures Reveal Our Nation&#39;s Future</h2><p>Discusses ancient biblical prophecies that have significance in modern politics and argues that the U.S. must protect itself by remaining steadfast to harmonious Judeo-Christian principles, democratic foundations, and moral conduct.</p><p>How is America tied into ancient biblical prophecies? According to author Michael Evans, a fundamentalist Christian minister, biblical prophets already predicted that America is doomed to collapse unless its government stops accommodating the Arab world for the sake of oil and instead offers full military and diplomatic support to Israel. He believes that God wants Israel to have full control of the West Bank and Gaza, and Americans are risking God's wrath by not fully supporting this biblical mandate. Evans also theorizes that much of America's problems--including the attack of 9-11--are indications of God's fury over America's split allegiance between the two famous descendents of Abraham: Ishmael and Isaac. "We are caught in a tug of war between two brothers--between oil, political expedience, and conscience in many ways--and it our decisions and polices concerning these two brothers that will determine whether the United States will survive or go the way of the Roman Empire," he writes. Evans's prophetic foundation begins with the parable of the fig tree (Matthew 24:32-44), in which he interprets the various signs Jesus gave his disciples to mark "the final age and his return." Obviously, the Bible can be interpreted many ways, and Evans uses 17 chapters to weave in interpretations of scripture that support his theory that America faces a mammoth choice--ruin or salvation. Although actual quotes from scripture are rather sparse throughout the book, he concludes with a five-page index of "Ancient Prophecies" that indirectly support his theory. One caveat--Evans (<i>Beyond Iraq</i>) does not hide his vehement anti-Muslim leanings. This book will probably be offensive to Christians who practice religious tolerance and lean toward a more-inclusive solution to American diplomacy in the Middle East. --<i>Gail Hudson</i>These words, spoken by his pastor to a future president of the United States, set the tone for author Michael D. Evans&#x2019; impassioned and wide-ranging exploration of current events in the light of ancient Scriptures and America&#x2019;s place in biblical prophecy. From the time George Washington placed his hand upon a Bible and swore the oath to become the first president of the United States, the Jews&#x2014;and more importantly, a Jewish homeland&#x2014;have occupied a crucial place in America&#x2019;s history. The second president of the United States, John Adams declared toward the end of his life, "For I really wish the Jews again in Judea an independent nation." Now, internationally renowned Mid-East expert and biblical scholar Mike Evans traces the efforts of American Christians to help establish a Jewish State through a "prophetic memorial," a declaration presented to five successive American presidents outlining the biblical mandate for a Jewish homeland. Evans describes in fascinating detail the events that led in 1948 to the birth of the nation of Israel. <p>The hatred of the Arab world for the West&#x2014;and toward America in particular&#x2014;can be traced entirely to this nation&#x2019;s identification with Israel. America flirts with danger, Evans says, when it accommodates the Arab world merely for the sake of oil. As God said to Abraham, "I will bless those who bless you, and whoever curses you I will curse." America&#x2019;s prophetic future hangs on the nation&#x2019;s moral vision and clarity. </p><p>The hostility of Islamic fundamentalists towards America can be explained succinctly, Evans asserts: it is rooted in bigotry, the ancient prejudice against Jews. Yet, says Evans, "America is cursing what God has blessed (Israel) and blessing what God has cursed (rebuilding Babylon [Iraq]). Does the Bible reveal what will happen to a nation that does this? A thousand percent yes!" </p><p>Mike Evans is the bestselling author of Beyond Iraq and has published articles in periodicals throughout the world, including The Wall Street Journal and the Jerusalem Post. He has been a confidant to leaders in Israel for more than two decades. He is the founder of the Jerusalem Prayer Team that organizes thousands to seek peace in the Middle East.</p></p><h2>Letters from Vladivostock, 1894-1930 (The Eleanor L. Pray Collection)</h2><p>In 1894, Eleanor L. Pray left her New England home to move with her merchant husband to Vladivostok in the Russian Far East. Over the next thirty-six years &#x2015; from the time of Tsar Alexander III to the early years of Stalin&#x2019;s rule &#x2015; she wrote more than 2,000 letters chronicling her family life and the tumultuous social and political events she witnessed. Vladivostok, 5,600 miles east of Moscow, was shaped by a rich intersection of Asian cultures, and Pray&#x2019;s witty and observant writing paints a vivid picture of the city and its denizens during a period of momentous social change. The book offers highlights from Pray&#x2019;s letters along with illuminating historical and biographical information.</p><p><b>Birgitta Ingemanson </b>is professor of foreign languages and cultures at Washington State University. <b>Patricia D.

Celebrated in rarified literary and social circles, she was hailed, alongside Mark Lindquist, Bret Easton Ellis, and Jay McInerney, as one of the original &#x201c;Brat Pack&#x201d; writers&#x2014;a wave of young minimalist authors whose wry, urbane sensibility captured the zeitgeist of the time, propelling them to the forefront of American culture.</p><p>In <em>Scream</em>, her first memoir, Janowitz recalls the quirky literary world of young downtown New York in the go-go 1980s and reflects on her life today far away from the city indelible to her work. As in <em>Slaves of New York</em> and <em>A Certain Age</em>, Janowitz turns a critical eye towards life, this time her own, recounting the vagaries of fame and fortune as a writer devoted to her art. Here, too, is Tama as daughter, wife, and mother, wrestling with aging, loss, and angst, both adolescent (her daughter) and middle aged (her own) as she cares for a mother plagued by dementia, battles a brother who questions her choices, and endures the criticism of a surly teenager.</p><p>Filled with a very real, very personal cast of characters, <em>Scream</em> is an intimate, scorching memoir rife with the humor, insight, and experience of a writer with a surgeon&#x2019;s eye for detail, and a skill for cutting straight to the strangest parts of life.</p></p><p><p><strong>Forever the misfit, tama janowitz feels like screaming</strong></p><p>In her first book since 2005, Tama Janowitz examines the events that led her through the 1980s to where she is now: (almost) broke, (almost) divorced, attempting to raise a daughter, taking care of her ailing mother, peacemaking with her eccentric father, and learning the strange mythos and culture of upstate New York, which, while only a few hours north of New York City, might as well be on a different planet.</p><p>Once declared New York City&#x2019;s literary &#x201c;It Girl&#x201d;&#x2014;hanging out with the likes of Andy Warhol and Lou Reed, partying at Studio 54, and coming of age alongside contemporary, edgy writers who together with Tama were deemed the &#x201c;Literary Brat Pack&#x201d;&#x2014;she has always been an original. She is a writer with many books under her belt, and her groundbreaking short-story collection <em>Slaves of New York</em> ushered forward a style that became emblematic of a New York City packed with sex, drugs, and urban grittiness. Tama left the glamour and glitz of the 1980s behind to be a wife, mother, and poodle wrangler&#x2014;only to find herself still searching for a sense of purpose.</p>Her traversal across memory, time, and place in <em>Scream</em>&#x2014;moving frantically back and forth between the city and the country, the eighties and today&#x2014;to uncover that purpose is a testament to her precision and capacity for soul searching. Crafted with humor, irony, and self-awareness, <em>Scream</em> is Tama Janowitz at her most candid and straightforward as she weaves memoir with her acutely unconventional voice.Tama Janowitz has published eleven books, which have been translated into twenty-two languages and made into several films. She lives in upstate New York with her dog, Zizou Zidane, now that the other seven have expired, and her quarter horse mare, Fox, with whom she studies under Stasia Newell.</p><h2>The Beautiful Visit</h2><p>The author attempts to capture the longing, excitement and comedy of adolescence in this story of a young girl growing up in the years around World War I.</p><p>Elizabeth Jane Howard was the author of fifteen highly acclaimed novels. The Cazalet Chronicles - The Light Years, Marking Time, Confusion, Casting Off and All Change - have become established as modern classics and have been adapted for a major BBC television series and for BBC Radio 4. In 2002 Macmillan published Elizabeth Jane Howard&#39;s autobiography, Slipstream. In that same year she was awarded a CBE in the Queen&#39;s Birthday Honours List. She died, aged ninety, at home in Suffolk on 2 January 2014.A young woman, the daughter of unremarkable parents, passes through an ordinary childhood with little emotional awareness until age 16 when she&#39;s invited by distant acquaintances to a house party, which becomes the beautiful visit and the measuring stick of her past and present. Such a novel deserves a narrator of the highest abilities, and Juliet Stevenson is just that. She captures her audience with determined awareness and delicate timing. She steers each character to its proper niche and manipulates the author&#39;s words with an intelligence one can hear. J.P.

In this unusual book he presents a persuasive argument for a new future for the planet, one in which we consciously progress from just conserving nature to actively rebuilding it -- Brian Eno A Book of Revelations for our times -- Farley Mowat Feral has really opened my mind to the history and possibilities of our landscape. It reflects a very real need in us all right now to be released from our claustrophobic monoculture and sense of powerlessness. To break the straight lines into endless branches. To free our land from its absent administrators. To rewild both the landscape and ourselves. It is the most positive and daring environmental book I have read. In order to change our world you have to be able to see a better one. I think George has done that -- Thom Yorke Part personal journal, part rigorous (and riveting) natural history, but above all unbridled vision for a less cowed, more self-willed planet, this is a book that will change the way you think about the natural world, and your place in it.

Of equal importance was the North's successful use of rifled artillery against that masonry fort, a technological turning point equal in significance to the much better known development of ironclad ships. The rifled cannon were developed in the mid-1800s and were first used in siege warfare during the attack against Fort Pulaski.<br>In April 1862, three of those formidable new weapons breached Fort Pulaski's walls within thirty-six hours, forcing the garrison to surrender and closing Savannah's port. This is the first modern account of great Federal labors, under terrible conditions in difficult terrain, to erect the batteries which sealed the Savannah River, isolated Fort Pulaski, and finally forced its surrender amidst the Union army's infighting over who should receive credit for the operation.</p><p>Fort Pulaski controlled the harbor of Savannah, Georgia, and had to be destroyed for the Union blockade of Confederate shipping to become effective. The bombardment of Fort Pulaski was the first example of the use of rifled artillery against a masonry fort. Schiller (A Captain's War, LJ 2/1/94) has written a very detailed study of the Union's preparations for the siege and reduction of Fort Pulaski. Utilizing personal accounts and official records, the author gives the reader an excellent view of the problems as well as the conditions that the Union soldiers encountered as they prepared the gun emplacements and then conducted the siege. Schiller's text is enhanced by numerous photographs and maps of the terrain, the fort before the siege and after, and Union officers involved in the preparation and siege. The book also contains a chapter on the history and development of rifled artillery. Recommended for military historians as well as Civil War buffs.?W.

C. Beaton</b> has won international acclaim for her bestselling Hamish Macbeth mysteries and the Agatha Raisin mystery series. She is also the author of more than one hundred romance titles and a series of romantic suspense novels, the Edwardian Mystery series. Born in Scotland, she now divides her time between Paris and the English Cotswolds.</p>The impecunious Lady Fortescue, widowed and alone save for two loyal, unpaid servants, has sold off almost all of the furnishings in her large Bond Street home and faces a grim future as a member of the aristocracy too proud to seek employment or charity, yet too poor to survive on the infrequent largess of wealthy relatives oblivious to her plight. Salvation arrives in the unlikely form of old Colonel Sandhurst, an equally impoverished retired military man who falls at her feet in a hunger-induced faint one afternoon in Hyde Park. The two decide to join forces: the Colonel will share Lady Fortescue's home, and they will invite others of their station and situation to live with them and pool their resources. Thus is born what eventually becomes one of London's most popular hotels, The Poor Relation, to which the nobility flocks to enjoy the novelty of being waited upon by members of their own class. Chesney, author of 24 previous Regency novels ( Yvonne Goes to York, etc.), gives her many admirers a real treat with this first entry in a projected series. She expertly sets the scene, recapturing the bawdiness and color of a long-ago time, and her characters fairly leap off the pages. The "poor relations" undergo adventures both hilarious and tragic; larceny, attempted murder, a satisfactory love affair and unlikely alliances make the hotel the liveliest spot in London. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Dancing With Clara (Signet Regency Romance)</h2><p>Miss Clara Danford decides that she must be careful about losing her heart to Frederick Sullivan, the devilishly handsome rake whose splendid kisses and passionate wooing may mask a dishonest soul.

His work brought international fame to the Moscow Art Theatre, which he had co-founded with Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko in 1897. During his early years at the Moscow Art Theatre, he directed the first productions of Chekhov&#39;s Uncle Vanya (1899), Three Sisters (1901) and The Cherry Orchard (1904) as well as a series of celebrated versions of Shakespeare. Stanislavski toured America with the company in 1923. After World War II, the US edition of Stanislavski&#39;s treatise An Actor Prepares (1926) became a bible of the Method school of acting.</p><h2>The Himmler Brothers: A German Family History</h2><p>Once upon a time the Himmlers were just a normal German family, middle-class, hard-working, well-educated. There were three brothers, Gebhart, Heinrich, and Ernst. Heinrich grew up to become the head of Hitler&#x2019;s SS, mastermind of the concentration camp system, and chief perpetrator of the Holocaust. When Katrin Himmler, Heinrich&#x2019;s great-niece, was 15, one of her schoolmates asked during a history lesson if she was related to the Himmler. "Yes," she stammered, at which there was a deathly hush in the classroom and the teacher, embarrassed and unsure, quickly moved the lesson on. As she grew older, Katrin gave her family history a wide berth, but married to an Israeli whose family was confined to the Warsaw Ghetto and with a young, half-Jewish son, she realizes that she cannot evade the past so easily. Katrin Himmler&#x2019;s cool but meticulous examination of the Himmler story reveals in all its dark complexity the gulf between the "normality" of bourgeois family life and the horrors perpetrated by one member and a more nuanced portrait of Heinrich himself emerges not a lone evil executioner, but a middle-class family man, loved and fully supported by his respectable German family.</p><p>Katrin Himmler is the great niece of Heinrich Himmler, head of the SS, Gestapo, and leading organizer of the Holocaust.</p><h2>Essays In Disguise</h2><p>The author&#39;s third collection of essays discusses literary figures such as Hemingway and Salinger, fatherhood, Ronald Reagan, television, politics, American humor, the Catholic Church, and other topics</p><p>Whether writing on Sinatra or Updike, Hemingway or the Catholic Church, the Mafia or Salinger, Sheed's always-exciting prose style and his uncanny way of extracting the most from his subjects never fail to leave his readers satisfied. His wit, neither Wildean nor aphoristic, does at times become gently biting, especially when considering, say, the intrusion of televised politics into American life. In this, his third collection of reviews, extended essays (many of which first appeared in the New York Review of Books ), and occasional pieces, Sheed is in top form. With his novelist's eye for detail and the nuances of language, he lets little escape his attention, or ours, a fact all serious readers must applaud every time they pick up one of Sheed's books.<br><i>- Vincent D.

The same highly successful techniques she deployed in<i>Agincourt</i> and <i>Conquest</i> will this time be brought to bear on civilian society, from the humblest serf forced to provide slave-labour for his master in the fields, to the prosperous country goodwife brewing, cooking and spinning her distaff and the ambitious burgess expanding his business and his mental horizons in the town.</p><p>The book will explore how and why such a diverse and unlikely group of ordinary men and women from every corner of England united in armed rebellion against church and state to demand a radical political agenda which, had it been implemented, would have fundamentally transformed English society and anticipated the French Revolution by four hundred years. The book will not only provide an important reassessment of the revolt itself but will also be an illuminating and original study of English medieval life at the time.</p></p><p>Born in Yorkshire, Juliet Barker was educated at Bradford Girls&#39; Grammar School and St Anne&#39;s College, Oxford, where she studied history. Widely acclaimed for setting new standards of literary biography, she is also an expert on chivalry and the world authority on medieval English tournaments. Her books include The Brontes, Conquest and the bestselling Agincourt. In 1999 she was one of the youngest ever recipients of an honorary Doctorate of Letters,awarded by the University of Bradford in recognition of her outstanding contribution to literary biography, and in 2001 she was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature.

He argues that unions don't grow slowly and incrementally, but rather in bursts. Even if the AFL-CIO could organize twice as many members per year as it now does, it would take thirty years to return to the levels of union membership that existed when Ronald Reagan was elected president. In contrast, labor membership more than quadrupled in the years from 1934 to 1945. For there to be a new upsurge, Clawson asserts, labor must fuse with social movements concerned with race, gender, and global justice.</p><p>The new forms may create a labor movement that breaks down the boundaries between "union" and "community" or between work and family issues. Clawson finds that this is already happening in some parts of the labor movement: labor has endorsed global justice and opposed war in Iraq, student activists combat sweatshops, unions struggle for immigrant rights. Innovative campaigns of this sort, Clawson shows, create new strategies&#x2015;determined by workers rather than union organizers&#x2015;that redefine the very meaning of the labor movement. <i>The Next Upsurge</i> presents a range of examples from attempts to replace "macho" unions with more feminist models to campaigns linking labor and community issues and attempts to establish cross-border solidarity and a living wage.</p></p><p>"Clawson&#x2019;s vision of a new labor movement infused with the dynamic strategies and broad agendas of the new social movements is not only persuasive, it is necessary if we ever want to create a decent world for those who must work for a living. A powerful book by one of labor&#x2019;s smartest and most enthusiastic champions."&#x2014;Robin D. G. Kelley, author of Freedom Dreams: The Black Radical Imagination <p>"Dan Clawson doesn&#x2019;t tell unions and other workers&#x2019; organizations what to do; he looks at what they are doing and what seems to be working best. The result is not only an exciting read, but a powerful argument for a more feminist and ethnically aware approach to organizing."&#x2014;Barbara Ehrenreich, author of Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By in America </p><p>"This thoughtful and bracing book examines a host of new initiatives that link labor organizing to communities, students, minorities, and women. Clawson argues that these experiments may show us the path to a new upsurge from below in which a revived labor movement would play a central role. We should all hope so, not only for the sake of a revived labor movement, but alsofor the sake of a revived American democracy."&#x2014;Frances Fox Piven, City University of New York </p><p>"C. Wright Mills once hoped that the agenda-setting contributions of &#x2018;a brace of labor intellectuals&#x2019; would help the unions move &#x2018;upstream against the main drift.&#x2019; Dan Clawson is just that kind of activist-scholar, whose commitment, insight,and imaginative connectivity are all on wonderful display in The Next Upsurge. His remarkable understanding of labor history, management tactics, and social movement dynamics will advance the kind of informed debate essential to the reconstruction of the American trade unions and the fusion between those institutions and new forms of 21st-century social protest."&#x2014;Nelson Lichtenstein, author of State of the Union: A Century of American Labor </p><p>"Relentlessly optimistic, yet judicious and rooted in careful research on recent developments in labor and other progressive movements, Clawson's highly readable book makes a compelling case for the potential resurgence of unionism. The Next Upsurge: Labor and the New Social Movements is a must read for anyone who cares about the future of labor and social justice."&#x2014;Ruth Milkman, UCLA, Director of the UC Institute for Labor and Employment</p><p>Dan Clawson is Professor of Sociology at the University of Massachusetts.

Though not as deep or authoritative as other books on grieving, this one covers more ground. Emphasizing the futility and harmfulness of shutting out grief, Brooke suggests ways to remember and memorialize the departed. Women often find it easier to grieve than men, she notes, while children reprocess loss as they develop cognitively. Acknowledging that the path of grief is variable, she observes that only some friends turn out to be reliable sources of support; the Internet and journals can be useful resources, as are physical activity and therapy. Brooke advises those who are grieving to start a family genealogy, suggests strategies for honoring a deceased spouse in a new marriage, and proposes exercises for helping kids foster positive memories. For those facing the imminent death of someone with a terminal illness, she recommends a videotaping session, offering a list of questions for the subject and camera strategies ("film your subject at a 45-degree angle, or slightly sideways, for the best image"). She also reminds readers of the importance of writing a will and other estate planning, providing information and resources. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Against the self-images of the age: Essays on ideology and philosophy</h2><p>Alasdair MacIntyre is one of the few professional philosophers whose writings span both technical analytical philosophy and those general moral or intellectual questions that laymen often suppose to be the province of philosophy but that are seldom discussed within its bounds.

Whether you re a beginner at canning or a seasoned expert, Canning Full Circle is a must-have. Canning Full Circle takes readers through the complete process of preserving fresh produce to the meals you can create. Not only are these recipes tasty, but they can help you and your family be self-sustaining and independent year-round. The relatable and resourceful Diane Devereaux inspires and educates with her approachable advice, helpful tips and home-tested recipes. Learn how to keep a well-stocked pantry all year round and how to easily incorporate home-canned goods into everyday life not just during canning season. Learning to properly can different foods is essential for camping, prepping, stocking for colder months, or just for having quality food around the house.</p><p>Upcoming indie author Diane Devereaux is The Canning Diva, a nationally syndicated food preservation expert, radio host, television presenter, culinary instructor and mother of two. For over five years, Devereaux has been sharing her lifetime passion of canning and translating it to the lives of busy families across America. <p> Her latest book, Canning Full Circle, is the first cookbook of its kind to bridge the generational gap of traditional canning methods to today s time-starved, over-extended families. Devereaux demonstrates just how easy, fun and rewarding home canning can be and answers the long- awaited question of what to do with canned goods after they re sealed and shelved for later use. </p><p> Devereaux started home canning at the young age of 13 and was soon growing and maintaining her own garden. The experience quickly taught her the many benefits of natural pest control, crop rotation and healthy soil factors, heirloom seed production and collection, healthy meal creation, and of course, preserving her garden s beautiful bounty. She later received her Bachelors in International Business from Davenport University and plunged into a career in disaster management, where she applied her skills in food preservation, survival and sustainability to those in crisis. Her background in home canning combined with her tenure in disaster management led her to create The Canning Diva�, where she blended her passion for gardening and preserving with her knowledge of preparedness and self-reliance. The Canning Diva has made several TV </p><p> appearances on WZZM Channel 13 Healthy You, WOODTV8 Eight West, WZZM Take Five &amp; Company and FOX17 News to demonstrating home canning techniques and signature recipes. She s also host of The Survival Mom Radio Network. </p><p> With fast food, microwaved meals and other preservative-laden convenience foods becoming the norm for society, the natural practice of canning is becoming a lost art. Now as food culture centers back to the importance of clean eating and healthy living, Diane Devereaux champions the practice of growing your own food, preserving your harvest and knowing exactly what goes into the food on your dinner table. </p><p> An avid supporter of non-GMO seeds, Diane advocates the growth of crops without chemicals, pesticides and genetic manipulation. She is a firm believer in consumers having the right to know the contents of what they ingest and is a proud supporter of honest and forthright labeling of all foods. It is because of this belief she chooses to home can throughout the year to ensure a healthy lifestyle for herself and her family. Diane has made it her goal to teach these time-honored traditions throughout West Michigan at various culinary schools and commercial kitchens, and it s the driving force of her new book, Canning Full Circle: From Garden to Jar to Table. </p><p> Fruits and vegetables begin to lose their nutrient level as soon as they are picked. By canning fresh produce right after harvest, you preserve the highest level of nutrients and the full flavor nature intended. By stocking your pantry with seasonal finds preserved at the peak of their freshness, canning allows you to broaden the spectrum of fruits and vegetables you consume throughout the year. Home canning also helps reduce food costs and wasteful spoilage. And, possibly the best reason of all, it creates memorable experiences for families to share together.</p></p><h2>The Wolfen</h2><p>They can stare into our souls.

Her publisher mentions Joan Didion, Anne Tyler and Nora Ephron, but none quite evokes the wry yet deeply felt and devastatingly feminine tone she has caught in Golden Daysrather as if John Cheever had changed gender and moved to California. There is Cheever's intense sense of place (Los Angeles instead of exurban Connecticut), of the passage of time and of the enormities that gape just below the surface of life in this tale of a breezy middle-aged woman coming to terms with life, men and, ultimately, nuclear war. Some of the material sounds familiar: marriage in the early 1960s to dreadfully wrong men, the depth and power of female friendship over the years, the California self-realization movement (for once, not satirized but quirkily affirmed) and, finally, the darkening into the 1980s and the coping with unimaginable nuclear horrors. But it has all been felt and thought afresh, and with startling sudden insights on nearly every page: on the way childhood memories linger, why men make war, how favorite restaurants somehow attain symbolic stature. A chapter that inhabits the mind of a philandering husband is uncanny in its accuracy and sadness. And the closing pages offer a vision of nuclear apotheosis and human survival utterly unlike anything in contemporary literature. Golden Days offers the excitement of discovering what seems like a brand-new talent, but enriched by a sureness of tragicomic touch that could only be the work of an experienced writer striking into bold new territory. 30,000 first printing; $25,000 ad/promo. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Mr. Monk in Outer Space</h2><p>Obsessive compulsive detective Adrian Monk returns to once again take on the crooked, in an all-new mystery, based on the popular television series, by the two-time Edgar nominee and author of Mr. Monk and the Two Assistants and Mr. Monk Goes to the Firehouse.</p><p>Lee Goldberg is a two-time Edgar(r) nominee who has written episodes for numerous shows, including <i>Monk</i>.

Not sure what to do next.<br><br> I should have known it was too good to last.<br><br> I had spent the last two months at Kilhenny Castle, Darcy's ancestral home. I had experienced the merriest Christmas I had ever known, with Darcy, his eccentric family and the Polish princess Zou Zou Zamanska. We had fought hard to prove Lord Kilhenny's innocence when he was wrongly accused of a crime and had managed to gain back his castle. The next month was spent making it habitable again. It had been a wonderful, almost miraculous time to be close to the man I loved, to actually be planning our wedding in the summer. Darcy had also been helping his father to restore the racing stable, now owned by the princess, to its former glory and they had succeeded in winning the gold cup at the Punchestown races.<br><br> But all good things must come to an end. Darcy had never been the sort to stay in one place for long. Neither had the princess. She had flitted between Ireland and London in her little aeroplane as casually as if she was going down to the corner shop for a loaf of bread. Then one day in March she announced that she was leaving to enter a round-the-world air race. Darcy's father, usually never one to let his feelings show, had stomped around miserably for days after she had gone. They were clearly fond of each other, but as far as I knew he hadn't declared his love for her. Perhaps his stupid pride made him think that he didn't have enough to offer her, either in rank or in fortune. Not that she would have cared. Zou Zou, as she liked her friends to call her, was one of the most open and generous people I have ever met. And I think she had definitely fallen for the roguish Lord Kilhenny. Who wouldn't? He had the same rugged good looks and wicked twinkle in his eye as his son!<br><br> Then shortly after Zou Zou flew off in her tiny plane, Darcy came to me and said he'd have to leave for a while. He had an assignment that he couldn't refuse. Even though we were engaged to be married he had never revealed to me for whom he was actually working, although he had dropped hints that it was the British secret service.<br><br> "How long will you be gone, do you think?" I asked, trying to look light and cheerful.<br><br> "I have no idea," he said.<br><br> "And I suppose you can't tell me where you'll be going or what you'll be doing?"<br><br> He grinned then. "You know I can't. And actually I don't know myself yet."<br><br> I stood there, looking at him, thinking how incredibly handsome he was with those wild dark curls and alarming blue eyes. I took his hands. "Darcy, will it be like this when we're married?" I asked and heard a little catch in my voice. "Will you always be going off somewhere and leaving me at home to worry about you?"<br><br> "You don't need to worry about me," he said. "I'm a big boy. I can take good care of myself. But as to what I do when we're married, we'll just have to play it by ear. Maybe we'll move back here to the castle and raise our children the way I was raised. But I want to make enough money to provide for you. You know that."<br><br> "Yes, I know," I said, fighting back an embarrassing tear, "but I'll miss you."<br><br> "I'll miss you too, you silly old thing." He stroked back a curl from my cheek. "I'll be in London first," he added. "I'll make an appointment to see the king's private secretary and see how things are progressing."<br><br> He was talking about our wedding, of course. In case you don't know, I am the daughter of the Duke of Rannoch, great-granddaughter to Queen Victoria and second cousin to the king. As such I am part of the line of succession-currently thirty-fifth in line to the throne. And members of the royal family are not allowed by law to marry Catholics. Darcy was a Catholic so the only way to be allowed to marry him was to renounce my claim to the throne. This was all rather silly as there was little likelihood that I'd find myself crowned Queen of England (not unless there was a plague or flood of biblical proportions). But the whole thing had to be done properly. Darcy had presented a petition on my behalf. Then it had to be approved by Parliament. The petition had been presented, but we had heard nothing. So the wedding date was in limbo and it was most unsettling. I rather wished we had managed to reach Gretna Green, as Darcy had once tried to do, and been married in secret.<br><br> But left alone in the Irish countryside, now doubts crept into my mind. What if Parliament refused to let me renounce my claim? Could we defy them and marry? We'd have to leave England and live abroad if necessary because I was going to marry Darcy. Nothing was going to stop me. But it was an unsettling time, suddenly finding myself alone at Kilhenny Castle with Darcy's father. He had never been the most genial of men. Now he was clearly worried about Zou Zou so he went around with a scowl on his face and became annoyed by the smallest of things-much the way he had been when I first arrived there in December.<br><br> I, in turn, was worried about Darcy, about the future of our marriage and to what dangerous part of the globe he might be sent. More than anything I wondered what I should be doing next. I sensed that Lord Kilhenny welcomed my company and would sink into deeper gloom if I left. And yet I felt lonely, unsettled and out of place in Ireland. I enjoyed visits to Darcy's eccentric great-aunt and great-uncle, who lived in a rambling old house nearby, as well as walks through the countryside, where roadside hedges were now blooming with spring flowers and the air smelled of spring. But I wanted to be gone.<br><br> My thoughts often turned to my friend Belinda who had fled to Italy to have a baby that no one should know about. Was she feeling equally lonely? She had suggested when I last saw her that I come and stay with her in Italy, but I had heard nothing since and had no address in Italy to write to. I hoped she was all right. I also worried about my grandfather in London. I had written to him several times, but had heard nothing in return since Christmas, when I had received a rather lurid card and a box of Quality Street chocolates. I knew he wasn't much of a writer, but I was concerned about his health. He had a weak chest and the London fogs were often brutal in winter. I would have gone to London to visit him, but I had nowhere to stay. My brother, the current duke, owned our family home, Rannoch House on Belgrave Square, but he and my dreaded sister-in-law, Fig, had gone to the south of France for the winter and Fig had made it clear to me that I was not to use their house while they were gone.<br><br> Zou Zou had also said that I was always welcome to stay with her when I was in London, but she was on a round-the-world race, which might take months. So I stayed on in Ireland, rushing to the post every morning in the hope of news from somebody. And then one morning I went out for an early walk. It was a perfect spring day. Daffodils were blooming all over the castle grounds. Birds were singing madly in the trees, which now sported new buds. The air smelled fresh and fragrant. It was the sort of day to go for a long ride, but the only horses at Kilhenny these days were at the racing stable and I didn't think Darcy's father would trust me with one of his prized mounts.<br><br> I was halfway down the path to the front gate when I met the postman, coming toward me on his bicycle.<br><br> "Top of the morning, my lady," he said, coming to a halt beside me. "'Tis a grand day, is it not? And a letter for yourself from London, no less."<br><br> He handed it to me. A fat envelope. I looked for Darcy's black, impatient scrawl, but instead I saw my brother's handwriting. So they were home in England again.<br><br> "I see there's a crest on the back of that envelope," the postman said, eyeing it curiously. "So it's from some lord or lady, is it? I expect it's important, then."<br><br> He was hovering, waiting for me to open it. Although I was dying to know why my brother might be writing to me after such a long silence, I certainly wasn't going to open it with the postman peering over my shoulder, ready to spread the news to the rest of the village.<br><br> "Thank you very much," I said. "I'd better go indoors and read it, hadn't I?"<br><br> I saw him watching me with disappointment as I went back up the path to the castle. Once inside I went into the dining room and poured myself a cup of coffee. There was no sign of Darcy's father. He went to the stables at the crack of dawn most mornings and I had become used to eating breakfast alone. I had just sat down when the housekeeper, Mrs. McCarthy, came into the room bringing a dish of smoked haddock.<br><br> She started when she saw me. "Oh, your ladyship, I didn't know you were already up, and me with no breakfast ready for you."<br><br> "Please don't worry, Mrs. McCarthy," I said. "I was going out for a walk and then I met the postman and he had a letter for me, so I wanted to come inside and read it right away."<br><br> "Oh, how lovely. A letter for you." She beamed with pleasure. "It's not from Mr. Darcy himself, is it?"<br><br> "Unfortunately, no," I said.<br><br> "My, but that's a grand crest on the envelope," she said, hovering behind me with the dish of haddock still in her hands.<br><br> "It's from my brother, the Duke of Rannoch," I said.<br><br> "Oh, your brother. Well, isn't that grand." She showed no sign of moving away. I was beginning to think that curiosity was a local trait. "No doubt he's got some news for you. That looks like it could be a long letter."<br><br> "Well, he's just come back from the south of France," I said. "I expect he's giving me a full report on his time there."<br><br> "Oh, the Riviera. Now, isn't that grand? I expect they had a lovely time there. All those yachts and things."<br><br> It was quite clear she didn't plan to move.<br><br> "Don't you think you should put the dish of haddock onto the warming tray or it will get cold?" I said.<br><br> She chuckled. "Would you look at me. I'd quite forgotten I'd got the thing in my hands."<br><br> As she headed for the sideboard with the various breakfast dishes on it I opened the envelope. Two more letters fell out as well as one page of writing paper with the Rannoch crest on it. I read that first.<br><br> My dear Georgiana,<br><br> I hope this finds you in good health. We were not sure where to send the enclosed, but I'm mailing them to O'Mara's address in Ireland in the hope that you might still be there. We did read in the English newspapers about the amazing turn of events concerning Lord Kilhenny and I must say I am very glad for you that he was cleared of any wrongdoing.<br><br> We arrived back from Nice to find the enclosed letters waiting on the hall table. It appears they had been posted some time ago, but the house had been shut up with no servants until we returned home. I see one of the letters comes from Buckingham Palace. I do hope it was nothing urgent. I took the liberty of dropping a line to Their Majesties' private secretary to say we had all been out of the country and I was forwarding the letter to you.<br><br> We all had a splendid time at Foggy and Ducky's villa-well, not exactly splendid. It was a trifle crowded. The term "villa" is actually somewhat of an overstatement. It's an ordinary small house on a backstreet in Nice, but is within walking distance of the sea. The water was too cold for bathing, but we took some nice walks. Podge was disgusted that the beach was not sandy, but he's a good little chap and amused himself well.<br><br> We'll be in London for a couple of weeks before we head back to Scotland and look forward to hearing from you.<br><br> Your affectionate brother,<br><br> Binky<br><br> I looked up. Mrs. McCarthy had now deposited the haddock on its warming tray and had returned to hover behind me.<br><br> "All is well, I trust, your ladyship?" she asked.<br><br> I folded the letter. "Thank you, Mrs. McCarthy. All is indeed well. And I think I'll leave the other letters until I've enjoyed your delicious smoked haddock."<br><br> I think I heard her sigh as she admitted defeat and went back to the kitchen.<br><br> When I had finished my breakfast I retreated to my bedroom and opened the other letters. The royal one first, naturally. It was from the queen, not dictated to a secretary but written with her own hand.<br><br> My dear Georgiana,<br><br> I trust you are well. I understand from the king's secretary that your young man has indicated that you wish to marry him and, given his Catholic faith, have expressed yourself willing to abandon your place in the line of succession.<br><br> This is indeed a big step, Georgiana, and one not to be undertaken without a great deal of thought. I would expect to hear from your lips that this is indeed your intention and that you are quite sure of the ramifications. To that end I hope you will come to the palace and we can discuss your situation over tea. Please let my secretary know when might be a convenient date for you.<br><br> His Majesty sends you his warmest wishes, as do I,<br><br> Mary R.<br><br> (You'll notice that even in an informal letter to a cousin she was still Mary Regina. One never stops being a queen.)<br><br> I stared at the letter for a long time while my stomach twisted itself into knots. Did this mean that they might not approve the marriage, nor give me permission to abandon my claim to the throne? It all seemed so silly. They had four healthy sons and already two granddaughters, with the promise of many more grandchildren to come. I should go to London immediately and sort things out with her. Let her know that I intended to marry Darcy no matter what. I felt my stomach give an extra little twist when that thought popped into my mind. Queen Mary was a rather terrifying person. I had never crossed her in my life before. I don't believe many people have dared to do so. The only exception being her son and heir, the Prince of Wales. She had let him know quite clearly that she did not approve of his friendship with the American woman Mrs. Simpson. Not only was that lady currently married to someone else, but she had already been divorced once. The Church of England, of which the king is the head, does not countenance divorce. I don't think the queen ever believed that her son would contemplate marriage to such a person. She trusted that he would do the right thing when the time came and make a suitable match, like his younger brother George, whose wedding to the Greek princess Marina I had just attended.</p><h2>Wit, Will &amp; Walls</h2><p>"Wit, Will &amp; Walls" is a powerful epic of an African American family&#x2019;s struggle for equality. <p>Betty Kilby was an "infant plaintiff" in the, Betty Ann Kilby vs. Warren County Board of Education, which followed the landmark Supreme Court case Brown Vs. the Board of Education. </p><p>The Kilby family struggle started long before, when her father, James Kilby, took on Old Virginia&#x2019;s deeply rooted apartheid system. James Kilby had been raised in what can only be called inter-generational semi-slavery on a farm in Rappahanock County. Like his father, he had worked at the owner&#x2019;s beck and call essentially for room, board and the occasional dollar. Ultimately, James Kilby stood up and led his family on their journey through terror, isolation and repeated defeats toward educational opportunity equal to that of white society. </p><p>Sorrowing, yet often humorous, "Wit, Will and Walls" is more than just Betty's autobiography; This book is also a family epic, spanning generations of Kilbys, with many frank forays into such areas as the "kitchen babies," sired by her family&#x2019;s white bosses, right up to the heartbreak of her daughter&#x2019;s addiction to crack cocaine.</p></p><p>Betty started her career as a $2.10 per hour minimum wage factory worker. She climbed the corporate ladder twice in two very different industries to upper management levels with such name-brand corporations as Rubbermaid and American Airlines. <p>She researched Warren County&#x2019;s History from 1836 to 1986. Her work was published in booklet form "Freedom Road", in the local paper and in the Shenandoah Valley Historical Review. </p><p>Betty has an Associates degree in Business Management from Lord Fairfax Community College; Bachelor's Degree in Business Administration from Shenandoah University and a MBA with a concentration in Productivity Improvement in the Workplace from NOVA University.</p>Her conversational tone as an author lends a blistering immediacy. -- <i>Mike Price, Fort Worth Business Press, February 5, 2003</i><br><br>Wit, Will &amp; Walls bears mentioning in the same breath with essential volumes of black Americana as Alex Haley&#x2019;s, Roots. -- <i>Mike Price, Fort Worth Business Press, February 5, 2003</i><br><br>Wit, Will &amp; Walls serves the essential storytelling function, but it also delivers a manifesto of determination. -- <i>Mike Price, Fort Worth Business Press, February 5, 2003</i></p><h2>Art &amp; Inspirations: Ruth B.

The aged, abused monarch&#x2014;a man in his eighties, like Harold Bloom himself&#x2014;is at once the consummate figure of authority and the classic example of the fall from majesty. He is widely agreed to be William Shakespeare&#x2019;s most moving, tragic hero.<br> <br>Award-winning writer and beloved professor Harold Bloom writes about Lear with wisdom, joy, exuberance, and compassion. He also explores his own personal relationship to the character: Just as we encounter one Emma Bovary or Hamlet when we are seventeen and another when we are forty, Bloom writes about his shifting understanding&#x2014;over the course of his own lifetime&#x2014;of Lear, so that this book also explores an extraordinarily moving argument for literature as a path to and a measure of our humanity.<br> <br>Bloom is mesmerizing in the classroom, wrestling with the often tragic choices Shakespeare&#x2019;s characters make. He delivers that kind of exhilarating intimacy, pathos, and clarity in <i>Lear</i>.</p><p>Harold Bloom is Sterling Professor of Humanities at Yale University.

Written and illuminated by monks, they describe every creature thought to exist in the medieval world and include all manner of fish, fowl, and mythological beast, however far-fetched. <br><br>Pauline Baynes, whose original line illustrations for J. R. R. Tolkien's <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> and C. S. Lewis's <i>The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</i> are known to millions, has revived twenty medieval and mischievous beasts, basing her tongue-in-cheek descriptions on various English bestiaries. Her delightful recreations of these fabulous beasts -- from phoenix to manticore, from bonnacon to yale -- hop, swoop, and gallop through the pages in antique splendor and will charm today's readers as readily as they astounded audiences centuries ago.</p><p>Pauline Baynes (1922&#x2013;2008) drew the original lineillustrations for J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of theRings and C. S. Lewis's The Lion, the Witch and theWardrobe. Her portrayals of Middle-earth and Narniahelped transform the books into towering classics which, in2000, were voted Book of the Millennium and Children's Bookof the Millennium respectively by the Library Associationin Great Britain. A Kate Greenaway Medal-winner for theDictionary of Chivalry, she also illustrated ThePuffin Book of Nursery Rhymes.Grade 4 Up&#x2014;Baynes introduces readers to the creatures and myths found in medieval bestiaries and explains how the books were made and how they were viewed by the general public. The rest of the volume details the commonly held beliefs that both peasants and scholars embraced about specific animals, from well-known fantastical creatures like the manticore and the unicorn to little-known beasts such as the yale and the bonnacon. Even real creatures were given mythical qualities: it was believed that the lion's young were born dead and licked to life by the father three days after birth, while the panther was known for breath so sweet it would summon animals to its side with its belch. Baynes's detailed gouache and colored-pencil illustrations, one full-color page per creature, are done in the style of medieval illuminations and highlight the strangest qualities these animals were believed to have. The artist shows great respect for the early bestiary creators while also giving the stories relevance for modern readers, offering real-life possibilities for why people believed the animals had supernatural properties. Though the subject material has limited appeal, this book will be a coveted resource for mythology buffs who loved Ernest Drake's <i>Dragonology</i> (Candlewick, 2003) and students interested in medieval Christianity.&#x2014;<i>Alana Abbott, James Blackstone Memorial Library, Branford, CT</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Accompanying all the new studies of the life of Jesus has been the question of Jesus&#39; identity. Was he anything more than a human creature? A key issue in this debate is the claim of Jesus&#39; preexistence as the divine, uncreated, Son of God before his incarnation on earth. Douglas McCready provides a thorough survey of the doctrine covering New Testament teaching, Jewish and Hellenistic background and historical development. He carefully weighs the evidence and engages the arguments for and against the Christian orthodox conviction of Christ&#39;s preexistence. Drawing on expert scholarship McCready makes this important subject of debate accessible to students and other non-experts who want to know the evidence and arguments for this central doctrine of Christian faith. This book will be especially useful as a supplementary text for theology courses on Christology or in biblical studies courses on the New Testament witness to Jesus Christ.</p><p>Douglas McCready (M.Div., Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary; Ph.D., Temple University) teaches religion and philosophy. He is the author of <em>Jesus Christ for the Modern World</em> (Peter Lang).A wide-ranging and well-written book. (Books &amp; Culture, July/August 2007)<br><br>"The new book by Douglas McCready, <em>He Came Down from Heaven,</em> is an innovative study, both exegetical and theological, of the classical doctrine of Christ's preexistence (more accurately, his pretemporal existence, I think). The author is widely read and writes with clarity, though some of his conclusions will challenge some modern thinking that regards preexistence as metaphor or myth. Rightly he sees both the intrinsic theological importance of the doctrine and its ethical implications. Here is a title worth its salt. I commend it." (Ralph P. Martin, Distinguished Scholar in Residence, Fuller Theological Seminary, and Azusa Pacific University)<br><br>"Thank heavens we now have a full-length monograph on the issue of the preexistence of Christ, which is fully cognizant not only of the scholarly literature on the subject but is equally at home with the patristic interpretation of the key NT texts, especially the Pauline and Johannine ones. Douglas McCready is to be commended for his thoroughness in dealing with objections to this idea, and yet also his pastoral concern to show the practical and personal importance of affirming this concept as a part of an orthodox Christology. Highly recommended."

Focusing on the parish of St. Sabina's in the southwest Chicago neighborhood of Auburn-Gresham, Eileen McMahon takes a penetrating look at the response of Catholic ethnics to life in twentieth-century America. She reveals the role the parish church played in achieving a cohesive and vital ethnic neighborhood and shows how ethno-religious distinctions gave way to racial differences as a central point of identity and conflict.<br><br>For most of this century the parish served as an important mechanism for helping Irish Catholics cope with a dominant Protestant-American culture. Anti-Catholicism in the society at large contributed to dependency on parishes and to a desire for separateness from the American mainstream. As much as Catholics may have wanted to insulate themselves in their parish communities, however, Chicago demographics and the fluid nature of the larger society made this ultimately impossible. Despite efforts at integration attempted by St. Sabina's liberal clergy, white parishioners viewed black migration into their neighborhood as a threat to their way of life and resisted it even as they relocated to the suburbs.<br><br>The transition from white to black neighborhoods and parishes is a major theme of twentieth-century urban history. The experience of St. Sabina's, which changed from a predominantly Irish parish to a vibrant African-American Catholic community, provides insights into this social trend and suggests how the interplay between faith and ethnicity contributes to a resistance to change.</p><p>For Irish Americans, as for Chicago&#39;s other ethnic groups, the local parish once formed the nucleus of daily life.

Ottilie Assing, an intrepid German journalist, met and interviewed Frederick Douglass in 1856, and it was an encounter that transformed the lives of both. Diedrich reveals in fascinating detail their intimate twenty-eight-year relationship, their shared intellectual and cultural interests, and their work together on Douglass's abolitionist writings. Love Across Color Lines is a profound meditation on nineteenth-century racial, class, and national boundaries, and offers new insights into the career of a preeminent American leader.</p></p><p>Mulatto ex-slave Frederick Douglass and half-Jewish, German-bred journalist Ottilie Assing were unlikely candidates for romance when they met in New York in 1856. But what began as an interview for a biography on the famed African American abolitionist turned into a torrid, extramarital love affair that lasted 28 years. In <i>Love Across Color Lines</i>, Maria Diedrich explores the labyrinthine sexual, social, and racial conventions of 19th-century American society with which these two intelligent people had to contend. Through Douglass and Assing's letters, Diedrich reconstructs the triumph and tragedy of their union. "Douglass was enchanted with his German companion, but he never again forgot that any liaison with a white woman could prove fatal to his political mission," she writes. "Assing," meanwhile, "respected the burden he had taken upon himself. She defied conventional notions of morality and became both intellectually and physically intimate with this extraordinary man, certain that he would marry her." When Douglass's wife died, however, he eventually married another (younger, white) woman--and Assing committed suicide. In addition to uncovering a vital aspect of Douglass's personal life largely overlooked by previous biographers, Diedrich's informative work looks at Assing's remarkable sacrifice, powered by a love that propelled her into America's bewildering racial wilderness. <i>--Eugene Holley Jr.</i><b>Maria Diedrich</b>, born in 1950, is a professor of American studies at the University of M�nster, Germany.

They murdered a policeman, had a shootout with pursuers, and then vanished -- eluding a manhunt that eventually involved hundreds of officers from more than twenty federal and state agencies. The crime and the bungled FBI investigation left behind a web of mysteries: Why did one of the bandits kill himself? How did the others escape? Why has no one in this impoverished area claimed the huge reward the government still offers? Most puzzling of all, what crime were they en route to commit when Officer Dale Claxton stopped them -- and paid for his bravery with his life?</p><p>Tony Hillerman assigns these real puzzles to his fictional Navajo Tribal Police officers -- Sergeant Jim Chee and retired Lieutenant Joe Leaphorn. The time is now, and the memory of the mishandled manhunt of 1998 is still painfully fresh. Three men stage a predawn raid on the Ute tribe's gambling casino. They kill one policeman, wound another, and disappear in the maze of canyons on the Utah-Arizona border. The FBI takes over the investigation, and agents swarm in with their helicopters, their high-tech equipment, and a theory of the crime that makes a wounded deputy sheriff a suspect. This development calls Chee in from his vacation, and a request for a favor draws in Leaphorn. Chee finds a fatal flaw in the federal theory, and Leaphorn sees an intriguing pattern connecting this crime with the exploits of a legendary Ute hero-bandit.</p><p>Tightly plotted and beautifully written, <em>Hunting Badger</em> proves once again that Tony Hillerman is a master storyteller.</p></p><p>The marvelous <i>Hunting Badger</i> is Tony Hillerman's 14th novel featuring Navajo tribal police officers Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee. Here the two cops (who appeared in separate books early on but whose paths now cross routinely) are working two angles of the same case to catch the right-wing militiamen who pulled off a violent heist at an Indian casino. Hillerman serves up plenty of action and enough plot twists to keep readers off balance, leading up to a satisfyingly tense climax in which Leaphorn and Chee stalk a killer in his hideout. But through it all, the cardinal Hillerman virtues are in evidence: economical, pellucid prose; a panoply of Indian-country characters who seem to rise right up off the page; vivid evocations of the Southwest's bleak beauty; and rich insights into Navajo life and culture. (Hillerman once told an interviewer that the highest compliment he'd ever received was many Navajo readers' assumption that he himself is Navajo--he's not.)<p> While first-time readers will find plenty to enjoy in <i>Hunting Badger</i>, it holds special pleasures for longtime fans. There's more and deeper contact between Leaphorn and Chee, and we continue to see further into the prickly Leaphorn's human side (though without fuss or sentimentality). Chee finally begins to get over Janet Pete (it took about six books) and inch toward a new love interest. And in a moving section involving Chee's spiritual teacher Frank Sam Nakai, the shaman provides a key insight into the case.</p><p> In a world teeming with "sense of place" mysteries--set in Seattle, Alaska, the Arizona desert, or Chicago--it can be a shock to return to Hillerman, who started it all, and realize just how superior he is to the rest of the pack. <i>--Nicholas H. Allison</i></p>Three armed men raid the Ute tribe's gambling casino, and then disappear in the maze of canyons on the Utah-Arizona border.

"The ensuing public opinion battle raged for months," writes Steven Weisenburger. For the abolitionist movement, "no case more incisively revealed the pathology of slavery, and no deeds better symbolized the slave's tragic heroism." But to those in favor of slavery, "her deeds demonstrated that slaves were subhuman. Only a beast would kill its offspring, they reasoned, so Margaret's child-murder proved the bondservant's need for Southern slavery's kindly paternal authority."</p><p> Weisenburger's account of Garner's life has a novelistic flair of its own, laying out the facts in crisp detail. He guides readers through the controversial month-long trial and its aftermath, with her return into bondage and, for a time, obscurity. <i>Modern Medea</i> provides a rich understanding of the realities of life in the antebellum South and the legal and cultural battles that took place over the institution of slavery.</p>Steven Weisenburger, professor of English and codirector of the Program in American Culture at the University of Kentucky, is the author of Fables of Subversion: Satire and the American Novel and A Gravity&#39;s Rainbow Companion.</p><h2>Forever Barbie: The Unauthorized Biography of a Real Doll</h2><p><p>Was Barbie was the first feminist doll? She always worked in interesting positions, never married, never had a child, and never did house work. Yet today, many women who played with Barbie when they were children consider her to be an inappropriate role model, although these same women often have interesting Barbie stories to tell.</p> <p>In <i>Forever Barbie</i>, cultural critic, investigative journalist, and first generation Barbie owner M.G. Lord tells Barbie's own story with clarity and intelligence, brilliantly shaking up many preconceptions. According to Lord, Barbie's phenomenal endurance says as much about our culture's ambivalence towards femininity as it as it does about Mattel's successful marketing of the convention-defying toy. In this witty and provocative book, she unearths Barbie's low origins as "Lili," a sexy doll for grown ups sold as a gag gift in post-war Germany, and follows her development through countless makeovers and career changes into a "traditional toy" and ultimately an international pop-culture icon.</p> <p>Interviewing the toy-company executives, fashion designers, and merchandizing geniuses who helped mould Barbie into what she is today, Lord takes a seriously wry look at the polyvinyl goddess who attracts as many detractors as die-hard fans. This new edition, the first to be published in Canada, features an up-to-date introduction envisioning a Ken-less Barbie in post 9/11 era and examining the controversial reaction to pregnant Midge.</p></p><p><p>Since Barbie's introduction in 1959, her impact on baby boomers has been revolutionary.

The author currently lives in Southaven Mississippi and Fort Lauderdale, Florida.An overwrought debut thriller set in the not-quite-ready-to-be-new South. It's 1983. To Black Pool, Mississippi, returns native Lewis Kincaid, drawn there by a dying mother. Not that he likes her muchshe's a drunk, plus she deserted himbut Lewis is never one to shirk his duty. She's black, Lewis's equally no-account father was white, and Lewis can think of a dozen places he'd rather be than in a town where biracial means second class at best. Theres Detroit, for instance, where he enjoyed the beginnings of a nice career in law. Now, however, to help pay the bills while he keeps his deathwatch, Lewis hires on as a deputy to Sheriff Dodie. It's a chance gig, which is to say it happens by telephone: Dodie, worn, weary, and a little dim, hires Lewis under the impression that he's white. Still, Dodiethat seeming redneckhas other sides to him. When the skeleton of a teenaged young black boy, victim of a 30-year-old lynching, is discovered, Dodie permits Lewis to investigate. It's permission granted reluctantly, of course. ``Things like that are part of the past,'' Dodie says. Not to be dissuaded, Lewis starts to dig, an activity that rouses almost as little enthusiasm among the towns blacks as it does among its whites. Unwelcome, unpopular Lewis gets beaten, shot, and nearly lynched himself. But indomitable amalgam of super- and soaper-hero that he is, he takes on all comers, resists all temptation (an adorable white girl throws herself at him harder than a Nolan Ryan fastball), and leaves Black Pool a degree more enlightened than when he arrived.

In <i>The Reformation</i>, one of the preeminent historians of the period, Patrick Collinson, offers a concise yet thorough overview of the drastic ecumenical revolution of the late medieval and Renaissance eras. In looking at the sum effect of such disparate elements as the humanist philosophy of Desiderius Erasmus and the impact on civilization of movable-type printing and &#x201c;vulgate&#x201d; scriptures, or in defining the differences between the evangelical (Lutheran) and reformed (Calvinist) churches, Collinson makes clear how the battles for mens&#x2019; lives were often hatched in the battles for mens&#x2019; souls. <br><br>Collinson also examines the interplay of spiritual and temporal matters in the spread of religious reform to all corners of Europe, and at how the Catholic Counter-Reformation used both coercion and institutional reform to retain its ecclesiastical control of Christendom. Powerful and remarkably well written, <i>The Reformation</i> is possibly the finest available introduction to this hugely important chapter in religious and political history.</p><p>Patrick Collinson is Regius Professor of Modern History, Emeritus, Cambridge. A renowned scholar of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, his books include <i>The Elizabethan Puritan Movement, The Religion of Protestants</i>, and (as editor) <i>The Sixteenth Century (Short Oxford History of The British Isles).</i> He is a fellow of the British Academy and holds the CBE. He lives in Derbyshire and Cambridge.Chapter 1<br><br>Reformation? What Reformation?<br><br>This is a book about the Christian West: western Christendom, almost equivalent to what would become "Europe," the Europe of the EU before enlargement but minus Greece. The western Church, whether obedient or disobedient to that self-appointed successor of St. Peter, the bishop of Rome, has never paid much attention to eastern Christendom, from which it parted company a millennium ago. Whether western Christendom is entitled to think as much of itself as it always has done, not least in investing with a kind of cosmic significance certain events in its history in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, is one of the questions lurking in the background of our investigation of the Reformation.<br><br>By comparison with the West, eastern Christendom is not monolithic but rather a family of Churches. Besides those claiming the title "Orthodox" and acknowledging the honorary primacy of the patriarch of Constantinople as "Ecumenical," there were and are other ancient Churches defined both ethnically and by ancient, half-forgotten, but apparently unbridgeable dogmatic differences. They include the Armenians, whose king embraced Christianity and made it the official religion of his kingdom early in the fourth century, a little before Constantine did the same thing for the Roman Empire. Another is the Coptic Church of Egypt, which went its own way doctrinally after the Council of Chalcedon (a.d. 451) defined "Orthodoxy," insisting that Christ had only one nature ("Monophysitism") and not the Orthodox two, a breach that has so far lasted for fifteen hundred years. Its daughter church in Ethiopia, which since 1959 has called itself the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, is something else, although until 1959 it received its one and only bishop from the Coptic patriarchate of Alexandria. Inseparably identified with the Ethiopian nation, its worship is conducted in an early form of the national languages of that country, and it retains many Jewish features that are perhaps fossils of early Christian practice, such as observance of the Jewish Sabbath and abstention from the forbidden meats of the Old Testament.<br><br>Although enough has happened to make it possible, and an interesting exercise, to write the histories of any or all of these churches, those histories have been relatively lacking in evolutionary, let alone revolutionary, transformations. None of the eastern churches has experienced anything like the Reformation and its reactive Counter-Reformation, although the schism of the Old Believers in Russia (from 1667 until the present day) may be the exception to prove this rule.<br><br>However, in all these manifestations of the Christian faith-as, indeed, in religion more generally and globally-we find the eternal principles of renewal and conversion. The Christian baptism of infants, which has in effect been compulsory wherever the religion has remained publicly and politically established, may suggest that the Church is something into which people are born. Yet it is individuals in their uniqueness who are baptized, and every child, through sponsors or "godparents," has to renounce the Devil and all his works and turn personally to Christ. For baptism is, or ought to be, that second birth that Jesus explained to the Jewish elder Nicodemus: "Ye must be born again." In Ethiopia, there is an annual ceremony in which the "tabot," a replica of the Jewish Ark of the Covenant, containing the altar stones, is carried with much ceremony from each church to the nearest water, into which the people plunge in order to renew their baptism. This is the time known as "Maskal" (which means "the Cross"), when the Ethiopian spring bursts out after the great rains, bright with yellow maskal daisies. The symbolism is obvious. In present-day Anglican churches, when a child is baptized the practice is to invite the whole congregation to repeat and renew their own baptismal vows. This can happen, too, at the European spring festival of Easter, another season of renewal.<br><br>In these examples, the principle of renewal is, to use an ugly sociological term, routinized. What is supposed to be an event becomes a time-out-of-mind custom and an institution: continuity rather than discontinuity. But the flow of religious history has always been punctuated and diverted by episodes and experiences of conversion. In the Judeo-Christian story, Abram was told by God, "Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred," and even his name was changed, to Abraham. Moses was called by God, manifest in a burning bush, to give up his occupation as a shepherd and to lead his people out of Egyptian slavery. The prophet Isaiah had a vision of the Lord of Hosts who said, " 'Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?' Then said I, 'Here am I; send me.' " John the Baptist summoned the people of his time to repentance in a setting full of symbolism, the Judean desert, through which flowed the River Jordan. Jesus told a tale about the repentance of the prodigal son who, when in utter dereliction, "came to himself" and returned to his father. Saul of Tarsus was on his way to persecute the early Christians when he was blinded by a light from heaven, the "Damascus road experience." This was his call to be an Apostle, and Paul (for he, too, changed his name) went on, in the opinion of many, to invent and construct Christianity itself.<br><br>This at least superficially repetitive factor recurs throughout the history of Christianity. The conversion of St. Augustine, thanks to his Confessions, became a paradigm consciously or unconsciously imitated and replicated. Francis of Assisi renounced all worldly goods and the very clothes he stood up in in order to reinvent the vita apostolica. Ignatius Loyola, a soldier recovering from his wounds, was converted by reading religious books (there being nothing else to read) and this was followed by a series of intense religious experiences out of which the Society of Jesus was born. What if he had been killed in that battle, or had found some novels to read? John Wesley's "heart was strangely warmed" on May 24, 1738 (moments of conversion are supposed to be that precise), when he heard Martin Luther's Preface to St. Paul's Epistle to the Romans read in a chapel in Aldersgate Street in London. The consequence of that event was the thick strand of Protestant Christianity known as Methodism. �lie Hal�vy thought that without Methodism there might have been an English Revolution along the lines of 1789. England had a religious revolution instead, which bred self-help, trade unionism, and a nonrevolutionary but sturdy popular politics.<br><br>It is, of course, that same Luther with whom everyone who attempts to write a history of the Reformation must engage. For without Luther, we can be reasonably certain that there would have been no Reformation, or not the same Reformation. Thomas Carlyle went further. His history was the story of heroic individuals, and he thought that if Luther had not stuck to his guns at the Diet of Worms, where he stood before the Holy Roman emperor and refused to recant ("Here I stand"), there would have been no French Revolution and no America: the principle that inspired those cataclysmic events would have been killed in the womb. No one would now make such a claim. But we can still ask the question: was the Reformation, or was it not, a kind of midwife to the modern world?<br><br>Luther on more than one occasion told the story of his own conversion. The different accounts are not entirely consistent with one another or with what we otherwise know about his life and career around the time it is supposed to have happened, when he was in his early thirties and a professor of theology in one of the new German universities. We know that the experience arose from a strenuous engagement with the theology of Paul to the Romans: the sufficiently technical, but for Luther thoroughly existential, problem of how justitia Dei, the punitive righteousness of God, was to be satisfied. Luther knew that Christ had already made satisfaction, as Christians had always affirmed, "for the sins of the whole world." But how was that satisfaction to be applied to the individual Christian believer? Only, Luther discovered, by faith in Christ's sacrifice. Human moral striving was actually counterproduc-<br><br>tive, turning the soul ever more in upon itself. That was as much as to say that God, who is merciful, makes us righ-teous by a faith that God himself works in us. This has been called a kind of Copernican revolution in thinking about God. God, not man, is the center and prime mover of all things, including human salvation. Theologically, that had never been in doubt. In practice, however, the system of medieval Christianity emphasized moral effort, in effect a journey toward a God who, Luther insisted, is actually reaching out to us. According to other references to this moment that Luther made from time to time around the dinner table, it happened in a tower where he had his professorial study in the monastic house of the Augustinian canons, Luther's religious order: the so-called Turmerlebnis, or "tower experience."<br><br>According to Luther, this was indeed an experience, not simply an intellectual process: "I felt myself straightway born afresh and to have entered through the open gates into paradise itself." But that was only the beginning, and he went on to explain that he told the story, "as Augustine said of himself," so that it should not be thought that he "had suddenly from nothing become supreme," or "with one glance at scripture exhausted the total spirit of its contents." Indeed, Luther did not come from nothing but out of the rich resources of late medieval theology.<br><br>We may be still more cautious about Luther's sudden Durchbruch (breakthrough) if we consider what happened at about the same time to an Englishman, the Cambridge scholar Thomas Bilney, who had probably never heard of Luther. Reading, in the elegant Latin of a new translation of the New Testament by Erasmus, the words that "Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners," Bilney tells us, "immediately I felt a marvellous comfort and quietness, insomuch that my bruised bones leaped for joy." That was the beginning of the Protestant Reformation in Cambridge, which led the way in all of England and, after that, North America.<br><br>There is a tension here between event and process that, projected onto a larger screen, is the tension be-tween the Reformation as part of the continuum of history and the Reformation as an extraordinary historical moment-as it were, a meteor strike at history. For Max Weber such interruptions in history represented the operations of what he called charisma, something that, as a social scientist, he did not presume to explain. Such figures as Moses, or Isaiah, or Luther, were "charismatic."<br><br>What happened to these deeply religious Catholics and children of the later Middle Ages was no doubt compressed in their imaginative recollections into an almost conventional scenario, biblical and Augustinian, of blinding revelation and a total overturning of what they had always believed and taken for granted. In Jesus' words, they had indeed been born again. The historian who wants to measure the watershed separating the medieval world from what overtook and overturned it must take seriously the perception that those living through these events had of an almost total transformation. Another Englishman expressed the wish that God would bless an elderly uncle, "and make him now to know which in his tender years he could not see, for the world was then dark, and we were blind in it." For him, the Catholic Church was not merely defective but actually antichristian, its pope Antichrist himself, the great deceiver. So the landscapes of both time and space were subject to a radical and seismic reconstruction, and a series of aftershocks would be experienced for a century and more to come.<br><br>Whole communities, churches, and states shared in both the initial upheaval and the aftershocks. As Luther's theology was systematized as Lutheranism, large areas of Germany, which is to say the governments of princes and cities on behalf of their subjects, formally adopted what became known as the Evangelical confession. Other governments promoted a variant form of Protestantism, more thorough in its departure from traditional Catholicism and developed in the cities and cantons of southwest Germany and Switzerland, above all in Geneva where John Calvin was intellectually and spiritually dominant. These were the Reformed churches, the title indicating their claim to be the "best reformed." Faithful to the principle of cuius regio, eius religio, the principle that the ruler determines the religion of his state, the Rhenish Palatinate in southwest Germany was successively Evangelical, Reformed, briefly Evangelical again, Reformed, and ultimately somewhat brutally re-Catholicized. The principle was defied in France, where a sizable Protestant (and Reformed) minority enjoyed strong political and military support, which plunged the country into decades of (partly) religious war. In the Netherlands it was turned on its head, religion sustaining a revolt against the legitimate government of Spain and helping to give birth to a new kind of politics, that of the independent republic. England, which at the beginning of the sixteenth century seems to have been one of the most Catholic countries in Europe, became, by the seventeenth century, the most virulently anti-Catholic, and the almost dominant ideology of anti-Catholicism fueled the civil wars that engulfed all parts of the British Isles in mid-century and later provoked the Bloodless Revolution, from which what passes for a British constitution derives.<br><br>This, however, is not where the inquiry should end. Nobody doubts that the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries were a time of change, confusion, and conflict for countless individuals, local communities, and whole states and nations. It is not wrong to call this an era of religious wars, comparable in scale to the revolutionary, nationalistic, and ideological wars of the subsequent centuries. The only question is whether these circumstances were so different from the experience of earlier and later centuries as to make this a major turning point in European civilization, at least as important as the Scientific Revolution, the Enlightenment of the eighteenth century, or the Age of Revolutions that began in 1776 and 1789. Making some of those comparisons, a distinguished historian of the last generation, Sir Herbert Butterfield, called both the Reformation and the Renaissance, which was its necessary precondition, merely internal displacements in European history. Others have doubted whether the Reformation represented any kind of radical departure from the mentalities, politics, or social structures of medieval Europe, or had anything to do with the shaping of the modern world. We may now find it helpful to speak of the medieval Church and its Reformation. Martin Luther, a medieval rather than a modern man, offered new answers to old questions. He asked no new ones.</p><h2>Three Edwards</h2><p>Covers important events and figures in English history during the reigns of Edwards I, II, and III</p><p>12 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Diaboliad, and other stories</h2><p>The only translation of Bulgakov's entire first collection of short stories, works which range from the surreal to science-fiction to parody. <p> Contents: Diaboliad, The Fatal Eggs, "No. 13, the Elpit-Rabkommun Building," "A Chinese Tale," and "The Adventures of Chichikov."</p></p><p>After a long period of suppression, Mikhail Bulgakov was discover in the West in 1967 with the posthumous publication of his masterpiece, <i>The Master and Margarita</i>. The present volume is the only complete translation of his first collection of short stories, plus six of his best feuilletons from the 1920s. The targets of Bulgakov's brilliant satires here include the Gogolian bureaucracy which mushroomed after the Revolution, the subjugation of science to the state, and the price to be paid when the new world of Communism clashes with the old order. Everywhere the reader will find Bulgakov's customary exuberance, brilliance and originality.Mikhail Afanasievich Bulgakov was born in Kiev in 1891, the son of a professor of theology. Medicine, religion, and education were the dominant careers in his family. Politically, the family appears to have belonged to the liberal monarchist camp. Despite an early interest in literature and the theater, Bulgakov chose to become a doctor. In 1914, as a medical student, he volunteered with the Red Cross during World War I. After graduating from the University of Kiev in 1916, he served in the White Army during the Civil War, and was subsequently drafted by the Ukrainian Nationalist Army. These experiences during the chaos of the Civil War in Kiev and the Caucasus would have a profound effect on the writer and his work. His two younger brothers disappeared during the fighting around Kiev, and later surfaced in Europe. In 1919, while in the Caucasus, he made the decision to leave medicine for literature; soon after he almost emigrated, but was prevented from doing so by illness. By 1921 he was in Moscow where his literary career began in earnest. <i>The Diaboliad</i> collection, published in 1925, was his major publication of this time, since his masterpiece, <i>Heart of a Dog</i>, could not get past the censorship. This same period saw the partial publication of his novel about Kiev during the Civil War, <i>White Guard</i>. Publication ceased when the journal serializing the novel was shut down; however, enough had come out to arouse the interest of the Moscow Art Theater, which commissioned a play based on <i>White Guard</i>. This play, <i>Days of the Turbins</i>, was the source of Bulgakov's fame for the rest of his life, and was a major sensation both due to its vivid characterizations and its portrayal of a monarchist family in a sympathetic light rather than as monsters, which was the norm at this time. By the late twenties, when he had a number of other plays in production (<i>Zoya's Apartment, Flight</i> and <i>The Crimson Island</i>), Bulgakov had drawn down the wrath of the critics who felt that everything he wrote was essentially anti-Soviet. This was a period of extreme polarization, and Bulgakov's career was destroyed by 1929. He would have one more original play, <i>Moliere</i>, staged in his lifetime (but it was quickly withdrawn from production due to the critics), but all publication of his prose ceased after 1927. In 1930 he wrote his famous letter to Stalin, defending his right to be a satirist, and asking that his country let him emigrate if it could not find any use for his talents. Stalin, who had actually seen <i>Days of the Turbins</i> many times, answered this letter with a phone call, and soon afterward Bulgakov had employment with a small theater. The Moscow Art Theater then found work for him, but most of the projects he worked on came to nothing, and the last eight years of his life were full of stress and disappointment. He broke with Stanislavsky and the Art Theater after the <i>Moliere</i> debacle, and began to write <i>Theatrical Novel</i> as a way of venting his spleen. From 1928 on, Bulgakov had worked only sporadically on his major work, <i>The Master and Margarita</i>; in 1937 he dropped <i>Theatrical Novel</i>, which would remain unfinished, and concentrated on the novel about the devil in Moscow. When he died of sclerosis of the kidneys (which had killed his father at the same age) in 1940, he had finished <i>The Master and Margarita,</i> but had not completed final editing corrections. This novel, which would be considered one of the best Russian novels of the twentieth century, was not published until 1966-67 (and then in censored form), twenty-six years after Bulgakov's death. <i>Heart of a Dog</i>, however, was not published until 1987, the height of glasnost under Gorbachev--more than sixty years after it was written--a true indication of just how threatening satire could be to a totalitarian regime.</p><h2>Raja Yoga or Mental Development</h2><p>Thousands of years before the development of Western social sciences of psychology, philosophy, religious studies, etc., the yogis of India, especially the branch of Raja Yoga, which dealt with human mental faculty, pondered with the same questions that today modern scientists are involved in. The results of many of these recent scientific developments clearly seem to be validating the premises of the Eastern philosophy, especially the Yoga Philosophy. This volume represents one of the best writings on the essence of Raja Yoga. As such, this book will be of interest to those looking for understanding human psyche, philosophy, spirituality, and an effective self help source in improving and developing the quality of all aspects of their lives.

They received the North American Nature Photography Association's (NANPA) 2000 Lifetime Achievement award.North America's big game species are large mammals, including deer, elk, buffalo, wild sheep and goats, mountain lions, and bears. They constitute a precious national asset that is certainly worth saving. Seventeen kinds of big-game animals are examined in this very informative and interesting text, which is accompanied by many breathtaking color photos. The characteristics of each animal are examined, as are its individual behavioral patterns and the conservation problems faced. Maps are provided illustrating each animal's current range, accompanied by track diagrams of the hoof, foot, or paw print with approximate dimensions, including distances between tracks. On an encouraging note, the authors point out that "compared to wild creatures elsewhere around the world, most of the big game species of North America are in fairly good shape, with a secure future, if we do not encroach further into our remaining wilderness." The advantages and rewards of trophy hunting with a camera are described in an appendix.

Key thinkers of the 20th century offer an essential alternative to these new doctrines of m-communication: Martin Heidegger, who saw humanity as &#34;the entity which talks&#34;, and Jurgen Habermas, current-day advocates of authentic communication. This is a close encounter between alien visions of communication - between the conflicting utopianisms of 20th-century philosophers and 21st-century &#34;mobilised communication.&#34;</p><p>George Myerson writes on contemporary culture and modern thought and is the author of 'Donna Haraway and GM Foods' in the &#x2018;Postmodern Encounters&#x2019; series. He is Reader in English at King's College London.&#x2018;It Was Good To Talk&#x2019;: Mobile Phones and German Philosophers <p>&#x2018;&#x201c;If you want to keep pace with the changing environment ... the global economy of the day, you need a fast means of communications,&#x201d; says Tansa Musa. </p><p>The BBC has just asked a citizen of Cameroon to explain what it calls &#x2018;mobile phone frenzy&#x2019; which is &#x2018;hitting&#x2019; the country. The answer is twofold. Mobiles are practical, they have their uses. But beyond the practicality, the mobile is the object which most closely embodies the spirit of the &#x2018;changing environment&#x2019;. If you want to assure yourself that you belong to the new century, this is the object to have in your hands &#x2013; unless it&#x2019;s a &#x2018;hands-free&#x2019;. This brilliantly concise response points towards a big question: how has the once anodyne &#x2018;telephone&#x2019; become the new must-have mobile? </p><p>At the moment, as the new millennium starts, we are witnessing, and being addressed by, a ubiquitous campaign to promote the mobile phone. This mobile propaganda is extraordinary in its energy, its resources and its cultural impact. There are the old-style ads, but there is also a torrent of &#x2018;information&#x2019; released through diverse media, on the web, via other products and sales outlets. You can hardly tune in to a major sporting event without finding the logo of a mobile company featured either among the competitors or over the occasion as a whole. </p><p>The promotion is twofold: its subject is first of all a whole new technology, and then an individual brand. This doubleness must pose interesting dilemmas for publicists of the individual corporations: can you promote your brand specifically or are you really just promoting the whole technology? There is plenty to say about the mobile campaign. You can deconstruct the images, as with all such publicity. You can find stereotypes and ideological undercurrents. But in this &#x2018;Postmodern Encounter&#x2019;, I propose to look at this mobile hubbub from a more surprising perspective, an alien perspective. </p><p>Our encounter will be between this new mobile culture and two leading thinkers of the 20th century: Martin Heidegger and J�rgen Habermas. (See &#x2018;Appendix&#x2019; for brief profiles.) In his great work, &#x2018;Being and Time&#x2019; (1927), Heidegger initiated one of the most important 20th-century discussions of talk or, as he also called it, &#x2018;discourse&#x2019;. These ideas were taken up, criticised and developed in different ways by many European and American thinkers, notably among German philosophers of communication, of whom the latest representative is J�rgen Habermas, whose &#x2018;Theory of Communicative Action&#x2019; (1981) has shaped two decades of debate about dialogue and modern society. The nub of this encounter is the idea of communication itself, for, in their different ways, both the 20th-century philosophers and the 21st-century mobile persuaders claim to be redefining what it means for human beings to communicate. </p><p>What makes this encounter a postmodern one? In architecture especially, &#x2018;postmodern&#x2019; often means the mixing of old and new, futuristic and archaic styles. This encounter is postmodern in that architectural sense: here the old thinkers come together with the new cultural wizards. Apart from striking sparks off one another, these alien perspectives also reveal &#x2013; as they collide &#x2013; something significant about the break between the old and the new centuries. Both the philosophers and the mobile campaigners are interested not just in routine communication, but in the road to utopia. For all their differences, the two &#x2018;discourses&#x2019; share the view that modern utopia will be about ideal communication.</p></p><h2>The Leader In Me Activity Guide Level 1</h2><p>This activity guide was created to introduce students to the principles in The 7 Habits of<br>Highly Effective Teens by Sean Covey.<br>The Leader in Me is designed to help your students succeed both in and out of the<br>classroom.

Having seen over the years what issues and questions his students bring to class, he now offers this engaging, accessible introduction to all the major beliefs of the Christian faith.<br><br> Meant especially but not exclusively for readers new to theology, Inbody's Faith of the Christian Church covers twelve traditional areas of Christian teaching: theology, revelation, faith, God, creation, suffering and evil, humankind, Jesus Christ, salvation, church, sacraments, and the end times. Inbody also dives into provocative topics not usually treated in introductory texts -- creationism, the devil, miracles, the virgin birth, and more.<br><br> The book's broad-ranging perspective, which intentionally defies labels, commends it to individuals and small groups from many church traditions. Quote boxes and illustrations drawn from popular culture make the text visually interesting and enjoyable to read.<br><br> Inbody does not hide his own stance on issues but presents a full range of interpretations and openly points readers to other possibilities they can pursue. The Faith of the Christian Church offers just enough questions to provoke reflection and just enough answers to encourage readers to form their own grasp on the Christian faith.</p><p>Tyron Inbody is professor of theology at United TheologicalSeminary, Dayton, Ohio, and an ordained minister in theUnited Methodist Church. His other books include TheMany Faces of Christology and The Transforming God:An Interpretation of Suffering and Evil.&#34;<b><i>Reviews in Religion &amp; Theology</i></b><br> "Students frequently arrive at seminary with deep faith commitments but often with a alack of knowledge of the Christian tradition and theology. Inbody's succinct survey of theology goes a long way in providing students with the background knowledge necessary to engage in theological reflections."<br><br><b><i>International Journal of Systematic Theology</i></b><br> "As a first introduction to a wide range of topics, something to provide students with a framework . . . , it is a very good little book. I will certainly be recommending it to students new to the study of theology."<br><br><b>John B. Cobb Jr.</b><br> "This book can be recommended to a broad range of readers. Requiring very little previous acquaintance with Christian thought or the intellectual history of the West, it formulates Christian teaching in an attractive and convincing fashion in terms that are acceptable to a wide variety of believers."<br><br><b>Thomas Jay Oord</b><br> "Too many introductory theology texts are one-dimensional. . . In contrast, Tyron Inbody offers a multidimensional text that covers the major theological issues of today and yesterday. He converses with contemporary culture and the contemporary church, with the mind and the heart, with the ancient and the postmodern. And his writing is understandable. This text explores a variety of traditions and ideas, yet it retains a richness and depth that will satisfy those who want to do more than scratch the surface of life's biggest questions."<br><br><b>Clark H. Pinnock</b><br> "This is a theology text written with actual students in mind. Treating matters fundamental to life, the book is both accessible and substantial.

This is Steinhauer&#x2019;s ninth novel, the first since his successful <em>Tourist</em> trilogy. A standalone, <em>The Cairo Affair</em> feels timely and relevant, cleverly relying on recent world events--a Wikileaks transcript, Gaddafi&#x2019;s overthrow, the Arab Spring. More than an espionage thriller, this is a complicated geo-political story and, at its core, the story of a flawed marriage, full of betrayals and dangerous lies. It&#x2019;s also an ambitious undertaking for Steinhauer. While his <em>Tourist</em> series featured rogue CIA agent Milo Weaver, <em>The Cairo Affair</em> is a complex narrative, entwining the stories of multiple characters, primarily a disloyal wife, her ex-lover, an Egyptian intelligence agent, and a CIA analyst. Pinballing across time and place, from Hungary to Libya, Yugoslavia to Egypt, featuring spooks named Rainman, Stumbler, and Sledgehammer, the puzzle pieces come together in a moody, low-tech, and unpredictable reveal. Having followed Steinhauer&#x2019;s trajectory over the years, it&#x2019;s a pleasure to experience a writer pushing himself--into le Carre territory, no less. <em>--Neal Thompson</em></p><p><b>Three players.

By examining rich archival materials including a series of films produced by the Klan and a wealth of documents, newspaper clippings, and manuals, Rice uncovers the fraught history of the Klan as a local force that manipulated the American film industry to extend its reach across the country. White Robes, Silver Screens highlights the ways in which the Klan used, produced, and protested against film in order to recruit members, generate publicity, and define its role within American society.</p></p><p>Honorable Mention, 2016 INDIEFAB Award in Performing Arts &amp; MusicRunner-up, 2017 BAFTSS Book Prize<p>Tom Rice is a lecturer in Film Studies at University of St Andrews.</p></p><h2>Amelia&#39;s War</h2><p>When a Confederate general threatens to burn Hagerstown, Maryland, unless the town pays an exorbitant ransom, twelve-year-old Amelia and her friend Josh find a way to save the town.</p><p>In this novel inspired by the Confederate ransom of Hagerstown, Md., Rinaldi's (The Coffin Quilt) backdrop is as compelling as ever, but the narrator's undeveloped character lessens its intensity. The story begins in 1861, as 11-year-old Amelia Grafton relates the Civil War's impact on her sharply divided yet tightly linked town: "Mama and I were Southerners, but not Rebels. We were for the Union, but not the Yankees. You have to be from Maryland to understand it." When Amelia's actions inadvertently contribute to the demise of her friend's father, a Confederate-sympathizing newspaperman, and his printing press, Amelia vows to remain neutral which, unfortunately, translates as a rather passive recounting of events through most of the novel. Among the book's strengths are some riveting characters both real (Generals Lee and Custer make cameo appearances) and imagined (e.g., the fictional Jinny Pearl shoots a Rebel soldier after he attempts to rape her and disguises herself as a man to enlist). The pace picks up in the last quarter of the novel when, in 1864, Confederate General McCausland threatens to burn Hagerstown unless its citizens pay an astronomical ransom, and Amelia must finally choose sides. However, readers will likely find the unfolding of Amelia's outfoxing of the general implausible (she applies white paint to alter the ransom order) and may not stay with the book long enough to witness the highly personal price of this war. Ages 10-14. (Nov.) <br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.Grade 6-8-Rinaldi writes about the Civil War through the eyes of Amelia Grafton, a young teen living in Hagerstown, MD. The story takes place over a period of three years, and readers learn of the townspeople's struggles as they are forced to split in their loyalties and deal with young men enlisting and families losing their most prized possessions. Amelia, a Yankee sympathizer, wants to make a difference by participating in the war effort in other ways besides preparing food and helping the wounded, the traditional duties assumed by women. In an exciting show of ingenuity and bravery, she devises a plan to trick a Confederate officer and save her town from being burned to the ground. While Amelia's character lacks the depth required to make a connection with most readers, the story gives an excellent sense of what it was like to live in an area so affected by this war.<br><i>Carrie Lynn Cooper, Eastern Kentucky University, Richmond </i><br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Hercule Poirot&#39;s Christmas: A Hercule Poirot Mystery (Agatha Christie Collection)</h2><p>The holidays can be murder&#x2014;and just in time for yuletide 2008 comes this holiday edition of one of Agatha Christie's most popular and confounding mysteries.<br><br> The wealthy Simeon Lee has demanded that all four of his sons&#x2014;one faithful, one prodigal, one impecunious, one sensitive&#x2014;and their wives return home for Christmas.

It ran through 7 editions over the course of 55 years and was widely distributed in England and America. <p>This reprint of the classic 1st edition includes comments by noted scholar David Manthey on the accuracy and methods used by Wyld, as well as updated astronomical tables, a summary of surveying instruments, and a lexicon.</p>Samuel Wyld very likely was born in Lancashire, England sometime in the mid 1660s. In addition to being a noted Mason and a professional surveyor, Mr. Wyld also earned a modest livelihood from a small estate. Mr. Wyld trusted his fellow countrymen more than foreign surveyors, being more likely to rely on the work of Norwood than that of Riccoli and Girmaldi. He was one of the first surveyors to recognize the brilliance of instrument maker Jonathan Sisson, inventor of the modern theodolite, wye level, and stadia lines. It is only to be speculated that some of Mr. Sisson&#39;s success was due to his association with Wyld.</p><h2>Feel Free</h2><p>Nick Laird has been an assured and brilliant voice in contemporary poetry since his acclaimed debut, To a Fault, in 2005. Feel Free, his fourth collection, effortlessly spans the Atlantic, combining the acoustic expansiveness of Whitman or Ashbery with the lyricism of Laird&#39;s forebears Heaney, MacNeice and Yeats. With characteristic variety, invention and wit (here are elegies, monologues, formal poems and free verse) the poet explores the sundry patterns of freedom and constraint - the family, the impress of history, the body itself - and how we might transcend them. Feel Free is always daring, always renewing, and Laird&#39;s most remarkable work to date.</p><p>Born in County Tyrone in 1975, Nick Laird is a poet, novelist, screenwriter, and former lawyer. His poetry collections are To A Fault, On Purpose and Go Giants. His novels are Utterly Monkey, Glover&#39;s Mistake and Modern Gods. Awards for his writing include the Betty Trask prize, the Geoffrey Faber Memorial Prize, a Somerset Maugham award, the Aldeburgh Poetry Prize, the Rooney Prize for Irish Literature and a Guggenheim Fellowship. A Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature, he co-edited the anthology The Zoo of the New with Don Paterson, and is currently a Writer-in-Residence at New York University.</p><h2>Minerals of the World</h2><p>Identifies over 450 of the world&#39;s minerals in colored photographs, with detailed description</p><p></p><h2>Elementary Principles Six Foundational Principles of Ancient Jewish Christianity</h2><p>Ancient Jewish Christianity Foundational principles book</p><p></p><h2>The Healing Imagination: The Meeting of Psyche and Soul (Integration Books)</h2><p>In this delightful, phenomenological account, Kittelson writes in lively pursuit of the language of hearing, an ode to the persistent primacy of the ear.

It differs from much traditional Christian spirituality in considering personal images important in prayer, both as a place of contact with God and as a revelation of one's own motivations. Much of the book explicitly concerns uses of the imagination in ministry and the need for clergy to study their unconscious, but the book reads easily with at times almost poetic expression that makes it widely applicable.

First identified in 1811 by Danish anatomist Ludwig Levin Jacobson, the vomeronasal organ has been implicated in the reception of pheromones, those ephemeral chemical signals animals use to communicate nonverbally.<p> Watson organizes his thesis around the seven broad classes of smells identified by pioneering naturalist Carolus Linnaeus: floral, goatish, musky, foul, nauseating, spicy, and garlicky. In each section, Watson presents evidence of a surprising and unacknowledged role of smell and pheromones in human life. Is it possible that first impressions are the result of chemical signals? Watson thinks so, and also that pair-bonding, fistfights, love of offspring, and memories may have more to do with our humble nose than we think. In what is bound to be one of his more controversial stretches, Watson implicates nasal plastic surgery in postoperative mood changes:</p><p> </p><blockquote>Every time a surgeon slices away at a nasal septum in the name of fashion or vanity, both sides of Jacobson's organ are at risk of being damaged or even removed entirely, without thought for the consequences.... If you are considering cosmetic surgery on your nose, know that it could deprive you of the very things in life which having a new, cute, little button nose were supposed to improve.</blockquote><p> <i>Jacobson's Organ</i> is full of Watson's pithy opinions and conjectures. Some are supported by science, some are not. But as we learn more about the role of the vomeronasal structures in human chemical communication, it becomes clear that a nosey approach is nothing to sneeze at. <i>--Therese Littleton</i></p>Lyall Watson is a naturalist and author.

John A. Lomax, the esteemed Library of Congress folk music anthropologist, discovered Lead Belly serving time (for assault and murder) at the infamous Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola in 1934. He immediately saw that Lead Belly was a walking anthology of African-American music, and arranged for him to come to New York, where he created a sensation.

Markham - originally a Shetlander but who had made a name for himself in London - had left the islands years before to pursue his burgeoning writing career. In his wake, he left a scandal involving a young girl, Evie Watt, who is now engaged to a crofter. He had few friends there, so why was he back in Shetland? Willow and Jimmy are soon led to Sullum Voe, the heart of Shetland&#39;s North Sea oil and gas industry. In a community where traditional values are held very dear by some, the advent of new energies, even renewables, is not always welcome. It emerges that Markham was chasing a story in his final days.

The prosecutor, Rhona Laing, retrieves an unmoored boat and finds the body of a man seemingly placed across the seats, a briefcase next to the body. The dead man is a former local journalist who made good in London. The question facing Perez (who is inching his way back to work after the trauma of his fianc�e&#x2019;s death) and Willow Reeves, a detective inspector from the Inverness Serious Crime Squad sent to head the investigation, is what made the journalist a target? The answer has repercussions for the main characters, the tiny island of Aith, and for Scotland as a whole. Cleeves has an unusually deft hand with characters; not one of them seems purely plot-functional, and Perez&#x2019;s character keeps deepening with each book. The rough islands cresting the Atlantic fit the bleakness of the murders depicted here. This series is one of two that Cleeves has going; the other stars Northumberland detective Vera Stanhope and is a hit BBC series. --Connie Fletcher</p><h2>The Awful Secret (Crowner John Mysteries)</h2><p>Gilbert de Rideford is a Knight of the Temple of Solomon, and an old acquaintance from Crowner John's crusading days.

Her creative brushwork in the xieyi hua or free form style of Chinese art was recognized by art experts by the time she was four years old. Her work has been shown in museums and galleries around the world and has even been featured on a Chinese postage stamp. Now 16, she has advanced from animal and plant themes to more sophisticated subjects, but always with an extraordinary sense of balance and grace and with a traditionally Chinese appreciation for the uses of space. This book is liberally illustrated with Wang Yani's artwork, in full color, arranged chronologically. In her paintings, monkeylike creatures, made furry and graceful with skillful strokes of watercolor brushwork, glide and cavort across the papers. Boughs hung with fruit and leaves provide accents and background. The color photographs showing the young painter at home, traveling with her father, and playing with schoolmates are a wonderful introduction to Chinese culture and to a remarkable young artist. Zhensun and Low's account presents a uniformly happy picture of Wang Yani's success and reads, in places, like a promotional pamphlet for her next exhibition. But the book is worth purchasing for several reasons: as a biography of a highly talented young person, as an explanation and introduction to Chinese art, and, most particularly, for the collection of delightful pictures of monkeys, birds, mountains, and trees that speak the universal language of fine art and will delight anyone who opens the pages of this unusual book. --Shirley Wilton, Ocean County College, Toms River, NJ<br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.An enormously talented Chinese painter, born in 1975, is the subject of this profusely illustrated biography. ``Yani'' is especially fortunate in her father, also an artist, who firmly believed (despite tradition) that Yani's art should be allowed to develop naturally, with minimal instruction and no classical exercises such as copying others' work. From her first promising scribbles at two, he provided the materials she needed; by the time she was three, she was recognized as a prodigy--a judgment that the beguiling art so beautifully reproduced here fully justifies. At six, her work was exhibited in Europe; she had a one-person show in 1989 at the Smithsonian. The authors touch lightly on Yani's apparently privileged background, focusing on the evolution of her art in response to her increasing skill, maturing interests, and enriching experiences (including travel) deliberately provided by her father. Dimensions and Yani's age at the time of painting are cited for each picture reproduced (though not locations--were some of the thousands of paintings sold? Is Yani also a commercial success?); two foldouts allow a better view of more extensive works; photos show the happy, intent girl at work at many ages; a detailed appendix describes the tools and techniques of the traditional style that Yani adapts to her highly individual work. A handsome book--and a fascinating, lucidly written portrait of a uniquely creative artist. Glossary; maps; index. (Biography. 9+) -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

She contributes recipes and features on food and travel to <i>Food and Wine</i> and <i>Bon Appetit</i> magazine and lives in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. </p><p><b> Introduction </b></p><p> This book is a recipe box, designed to introduce you to an ancient way of cooking, one that translates beautifully into the language and demands of the 21st-century kitchen. Simple in concept, essentially healthy and intrinsically quick, stir-frying makes sense for Western cooks, whether they are experts or novice cooks. With stir-frying in your kitchen repertoire, you have almost endless options for making delicious, healthful home-cooked meals, even on a busy day. </p><p> Wonderful as it is, stir-fry cooking is presented here not to replace the cooking methods you use now, but rather to offer you another technique to use in cooking wonderful, satisfying and delightful food in your kitchen. If you don't cook, it's an excellent place to get started. If you do cook, stir-fry cooking fits right in to what you already do, while expanding your options to create wonderful food. </p><p> I consider stir-fry cooking to be an essential part of my repertoire as a cook and I use it often to bring freshly cooked, beautiful and delicious food to our dinner table. I still stew, saut�, fry, steam and grill. I still make curries and soup and slow-cooker feasts, and I love having breakfast for dinner, meaning pancakes with maple syrup and sausage, or eggs and bacon and grits on a dark, wintry night. But stir-fry cooking is a cornerstone of my kitchen routine -- a simple, endlessly varied kitchen technique that helps me cook weeknight dinners for my family and celebration meals for our extended family and friends. </p><p> The main course dishes in this book presume that you will enjoy them Asian-style, as a flavorful and substantial accompaniment to rice. Quantities of meat and vegetables in a given dish in most cases serve four people who are eating them along with a generous portion of rice or noodles or couscous or another satisfying accompaniment. </p><p> Unlike a European-style stew or a bowl of chili con came, which can be a meal in a bowl along with an optional serving of bread, stir-fried dishes exist in tandem with rice or another grain or noodle. They are seasoned to this end, with generous amounts of salt, herbs, and other intense ingredients, so that the flavors of the stir-fry balance and brighten the "comfort food" portion of the meal, which traditionally consists of unseasoned rice. </p><p> One reason for this is that rice is what Asia has been eating for thousands of years, even before the wok appeared on the culinary scene as a tool for cooking. In Thailand, the very word for stir-fries and other substantial dishes, such as curries, steamed fish and soups, is "with-rice." It is a phrase, used as a noun, to encompass all that will be provided as a meal. It acknowledges that the traditional role of such dishes is to season, accompany and make more delightful the rice, which on any given evening was all that was available along with chiles, fish from the stream and greens from the garden. </p><p> I hope you enjoy learning how to stir-fry or that you find a few new recipes to add to your repertoire if you already know how. I hope that your cooking brings you pride and pleasure. I hope that it makes your table a place where you can set aside your cares and enjoy being here, now, eating good food, whether you are alone, with family, or with friends. </p><p> Nancie McDermott </p></p><h2>Medieval Handbooks of Penance</h2><p><p>Guidelines for medieval clerics on how to assign appropriate penances for particular sins, in readable translations with detailed introductions.</p></p><p>&#39;Long understood to be crucial evidence for the nature of the early medieval church, ...[these penitential books] are now used by historians as telling evidence for sexuality, violence, the family, death rituals, witchcraft and other topics central to the so-called new social and cultural history.

Not only did Steinbeck devote himself to his work with passion and discipline, but he also suffered from the deep anxiety and feelings of unworthiness that plague so many creative people. Sadly, his fears were all too often confirmed by an influential group of critics who savaged every book he published after the phenomenal success of The Grapes of Wrath in 1939. This critical scorn was diametrically opposed to Steinbeck's worldwide popularity, but Parini does suggest that Steinbeck would have benefited from a firmer editorial hand. At any rate, Steinbeck's struggles weren't confined to literature; he experienced plenty of conflict and pain on the familial and marital fronts as well. As Parini chronicles Steinbeck's youth, key friendships, marriages, travels, and the creation of each book, play, and film (Steinbeck loved writing scripts and making movies), he traces the evolution of Steinbeck's somewhat romantic and sentimental but unquestionably significant philosophy. In sum, Parini's finely wrought portrait of Steinbeck presents a quixotic, didactic, yet heroic figure fired with "moral outrage" and centered by a profound respect for nature and belief in the importance of stories. <i>Donna Seaman</i></p><h2>Searching for Socialism: The Project of the Labour New Left from Benn to Corbyn</h2><p><b>A new and essential history of the Labour new left from Tony Benn to Jeremy Corbyn.</b><br><br>Jeremy Corbyn's rapid ascent to the leadership of the Labour Party, driven by a groundswell of popular support particularly among the young, was met at the time by a baffled media.

Although her half-Chinese mother looks "like any English mum," and her brother is blonde, Li-la closely resembles the Chinese relations she has never met. Her father claims they are "too pernickity" for him, while her mother sighs that Dad is "too rough and ready" for them. Still, Li-la longs to know her Chinese grandmother's brother. Encouraged by conversations with the Fu-dog, Li-la persuades Malcolm to take her to London. Without their parents' knowledge, they make the train journey and manage, by great good fortune, to find Great Uncle's restaurant in London's Chinatown just as Chinese New Year celebrations begin.

With the gift of a satin toy dog, Li-la's Great Uncle sets in motion the events that will eventually reconcile the two halves of the seven-year-old's family in London's Chinatown. Only Li-la can hear the Fu-dog speak--until she journeys to London where her skeptical brother Malcolm is injured, the Fu-dog is lost and all is resolved by the children's mysterious uncle who restores Fu-dog to Li-la in the form of a "real" Peking puppy. Images echo like the voice of the Fu-dog in Godden's ( The Story of Holly and Ivy ) affectingly told and neatly plotted narrative. The story is central in this 64-page, six-chapter novella, but seems well suited to the picture book format in which Littlewood's vibrant full-color illustrations and artful blue line drawings enhance but never overshadow the text.

Accompanied by her maid Willow, a shapechanger of the fox people, Silver Snow, daughter of a disgraced general, is dispatched to court as a potential new concubine for the emperor. Because she is too poor to bribe him, however, the chief eunuch depicts her as uncivilized and ugly and she is banished to the Cold Palace without ever meeting the emperor. When members of the Hsiung-nu migrant horde come seeking peace and a Han princess as bride for their shan-yu (leader) Khujanga, Silver Snow is chosen as a subtle insult. The intelligent and active girl sees an opportunity to bring her father back to favor and restore her family. Becoming bride in name only to the elderly Khujanga, she gains the love and respect of the horsemen and her husband, but also provokes the enmity of the shaman Strong Tongue, first wife of the shan-yu and mother of his vicious son. Norton and Shwartz bring a little-known time vividly to life, creating a believable heroine in an era when women were considered chattels or playthings. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.The daughter of a general banished from the Imperial presence accepts her fate as a political tool and turns a marriage of convenience to an aging barbarian chief into a crusade to bring honor to her family and avert a catastrophic war.

A proper understanding of biblical theology, explains the author, &#39;shows us an inner center of plan to which each biblical writer consciously and deliberately contributed; however, this inner biblical unity, which biblical theologians traditionally have been loathe to adopt for fear of gratuitously imposing a grid of their own devising over the text, is a center that is inductively supplied and confirmed by the text of Scripture itself. That center is the promise of God.&#39; In Part I of his book, Dr. Kaiser discusses the inherent difficulty in determining the true nature, method, scope, and motivation for Old Testament theology. In Part II, he applies his solutions clearly and methodically by chronologically discussing the Old Testament eras from the Prepatriarchical (Prolegomena to the Promise) to that of the Postexillic (Triumph of the Promise). A special section examines the connections between Old and New Testament theology. &#39;This textbook is different,&#39; says Dr. Kaiser, &#39;in that it takes the Bible&#39;s own system of organization as the solution to the very issues that have perplexed us the most, while also strictly observing the historical sequence of divine revelation.&#39; Toward an Old Testament Theology includes an annotated bibliography and topical, Scripture, and name indexes.</p><p>Walter C.

In <i>Citizen Lane</i> he tells the story of his remarkable life, demonstrating how a single dedicated individual can fight for the underdog, provoke the establishment, and trigger change.

But his problems are hardly behind him. A man's in jail, accused of murder. But did he do it? By aiding a beguiling woman, Billy stumbles on evidence that could exonerate the defendant, who only months before was one of the town's top fight promoters. One big problem - the victim was Billy's secret lover, and he has no desire to help set her killer free.<br>But once his reporter's instincts kick in, Billy can't let go of a twisting trail of suspense that stretches from Tenderloin fight clubs to Marina district mansions, from mountain retreats to the Hall of Justice. He squares off with an intriguing cast of characters: a bombastic novelties promoter, a former colleague turned muckraking lawyer, a society doyenne on the skids, a crooked booze distributor, a shifty deputy DA, an opera-crooning pugilist, a homespun abortionist, a crafty and celebrated defense attorney, a murderous stalker - and the unfathomable Virginia Wagner, a leggy legal secretary with many more secrets than just the gun in her handbag.</p><p>San Francisco boxing columnist Billy Nichols figured he'd covered all the angles and pinned the blame where it belonged for the pair of killings that lay at the racing heart of Eddie Muller's first noirish crime novel, <i>The Distance</i>. But he didn't know the half of it. Now, in <i>Shadow Boxer</i>, the loose ends that Nichols left hanging entangle him in a conspiracy involving coerced testimony, a multi-million-dollar bunco racket, and stolen evidence that the reporter fears could liberate the man accused of murdering his lover, Claire Escalante.<p> It's late 1948, only months after Claire's death, and Nichols (aka "Mr. Boxing") would rather see her killer "rot in a prison cell, for life," than help him prove that he's being sacrificed to cover up a more extensive criminal operation. Yet when the defendant's former secretary--hiding out to protect her life--shares with Nichols a file of dubious trust documents linking her ex-boss to a prominent but freshly deceased lawyer, the newspaperman smells a story--a stink, really--that carries all the way up from San Francisco's ringside seats, through a backroom abortion clinic, and into the city's top law-enforcement offices. Nichols, shaped by both the newsroom and the sometimes larcenous sport he loves, is an appropriately flawed protagonist, engagingly employed by Muller, a film-noir authority (<i>The Art of Noir</i>) and the son of a renowned Bay Area boxing writer. <i>Shadow Boxer</i> spends regrettably less time in seedy arenas and sweaty locker rooms than its predecessor, and its convoluted plot may knock some readers for a loop. However, Muller's hard-muscled prose and fast-count pacing still make his second novel a main attraction. <i>--J. Kingston Pierce</i></p><b>Eddie Muller,</b> son of the famed San Francisco boxing writer of the same name, grew up in newsrooms and boxing arenas.

This means that states&#x2019; jurisdictions and rule systems clash. How have they negotiated their differences over freedom and security? <i>Of Privacy and Power</i> investigates how the European Union and United States, the two major regulatory systems in world politics, have regulated privacy and security, and how their agreements and disputes have reshaped the transatlantic relationship.</p><p>The transatlantic struggle over freedom and security has usually been depicted as a clash between a peace-loving European Union and a belligerent United States. Henry Farrell and Abraham Newman demonstrate how this misses the point. The real dispute was between two transnational coalitions&#x2015;one favoring security, the other liberty&#x2015;whose struggles have reshaped the politics of surveillance, e-commerce, and privacy rights. Looking at three large security debates in the period since 9/11, involving Passenger Name Record data, the SWIFT financial messaging controversy, and Edward Snowden&#x2019;s revelations, the authors examine how the powers of border-spanning coalitions have waxed and waned. Globalization has enabled new strategies of action, which security agencies, interior ministries, privacy NGOs, bureaucrats, and other actors exploit as circumstances dictate.</p><p>The first serious study of how the politics of surveillance has been transformed, <i>Of Privacy and Power</i> offers a fresh view of the role of information and power in a world of economic interdependence.</p></p><p><b>Henry Farrell </b>is professor of political science and international affairs at George Washington University.

Twitter @ANewman_forward"An important contribution to political science, expanding on their concept of 'weaponized interdependence,' namely how the U.S. (and sometimes other political actors) uses access to international networks, such as SWIFT, to push other nations around."<b>---Tyler Cowen, <i>Marginal Revolution</i></b><br><br>"Showcasing a 'new interdependence' framework, <i>Of Privacy and Power</i> analyzes how overlaps in the rules governing global information flows create power asymmetries that destabilize domestic policy bargains. The result is an understanding of the world where stable equilibria are rare, and distinctions between the national and the international are erased. This book delivers a politics of scale that gives researchers a useful structure for studying the international political economy as an integrated but unstable system."<b>&#x2015;Mark Blyth, Brown University </b><br><br>"This book persuasively argues that substate actors, including interior ministries and data protection officials, form international networks to accomplish internationally what they cannot win domestically. The clearest value of the book comes from its diverse case studies. The discussion of the 2000 Safe Harbor for commercial transfers of personal data from the European Union to the United States is particularly outstanding."<b>&#x2015;Peter Swire, Georgia Institute of Technology </b><br><br>"Unlike critics who see transatlantic security relationships as hegemonic or conflictual, Farrell and Newman discern connections that are deeply ambivalent and increasingly institutionalized. In <i>Of Privacy and Power</i>, they show that these relationships are profoundly restructuring the domestic institutions governing freedom and security on both sides of the Atlantic. Their bold concept of &#x2018;the new interdependence&#x2019; should lead liberal internationalists and neorealists to revisit their views of the transatlantic order."<b>&#x2015;Sidney Tarrow, author of <i>The New Transnational Activism</i></b></p><h2>Roadside Magic (Gallow and Ragged, 2)</h2><p><b><i>New York Times b</i>estselling author Lilith Saintcrow returns to dark fantasy with the second novel in her Gallow &amp; Ragged series where the faery world inhabits diners, dive bars and trailer parks.</b><br><br>Robin Ragged has revenge to wreak and redemption to steal.

While everyone else in the early 1980s was reading Derrida, she was happily absorbed with Jane Austen and George Eliot: purveyors of the marriage plot that lies at the heart of the greatest English novels. Madeleine was the girl who dressed a little too nicely for the taste of her more bohemian friends, the perfect girlfriend whose college love life, despite her good looks, hadn't lived up to expectations.<br><br>But now, in the spring of her senior year, Madeleine has enrolled in a semiotics course "to see what all the fuss is about," and, for reasons that have nothing to do with school, life and literature will never be the same. Not after she falls in love with Leonard Morten - charismatic loner, college Darwinist and lost Oregon boy - who is possessed of seemingly inexhaustible energy and introduces her to the ecstasies of immediate experience. And certainly not after Mitchell Grammaticus - devotee of Patti Smith and Thomas Merton - resurfaces in her life, obsessed with the idea that Madeleine is destined to be his mate.<br><br>The triangle in this amazing and delicious novel about a generation beginning to grow up is age old, and completely fresh and surprising. With devastating wit, irony and an abiding understanding and love for his characters, Jeffrey Eugenides resuscitates the original energies of the novel while creating a story so contemporary that it reads like the intimate journal of our own lives.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, October 2011:</strong> Even among authors, Jeffrey Eugenides possesses a rare talent for being able to inhabit his characters. In <em>The Marriage Plot</em>, his third novel and first in ten years (following the Pulitzer Prize-winning <em>Middlesex</em>), Eugenides describes a year or so in the lives of three college seniors at Brown in the early 80s. There is Madeleine, a self-described &#x201c;incurable romantic&#x201d; who is slightly embarrassed at being so normal. There is Leonard, a brilliant, temperamental student from the Pacific Northwest. And completing the triangle is Mitchell, a Religious Studies major from Eugenides&#x2019; own Detroit. What follows is a book delivered in sincere and genuine prose, tracing the end of the students&#x2019; college days and continuing into those first, tentative steps toward true adulthood. This is a thoughtful and at times disarming novel about life, love, and discovery, set during a time when so much of life seems filled with deep portent. <em>--Chris Schluep</em>JEFFREY EUGENIDES was born in Detroit and attended Brown and Stanford Universities. His first novel, <b>The Virgin Suicides</b>, was published to great acclaim in 1993, and he has received numerous awards for his work. In 2003, Eugenides received the Pulitzer Prize for his novel <b>Middlesex</b>, which was also a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award, the IMPAC Dublin Literary Award, and France's Prix Medicis, and has sold more than 3 million copies.</p><h2>Guide to Capturing a Plum Blossom</h2><p>Guide to Capturing a Plum Blossom aims not at technical artistic training but at the training of artistic perception: not how to hold a brush but rather how to really see a plum blossom.<br>First published in A.D. 1238, Guide to Capturing a Plum Blossom may be the world's first printed book of art and literature; it is presented here in a fine bilingual edition.

Baba&#x2019;s not here. We were supposed to leave for the party like an hour ago. And now we&#x2019;re stuck at home, because people are coming over.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Your whining doesn&#x2019;t make it any better,&#x201d; I snap at her. She&#x2019;s right that it&#x2019;s been a pretty disappointing day so far. Baba had to fly out for an interview in Maryland early this morning, before the rest of us went to the mosque for prayers. It&#x2019;s our first Eid without him, and everyone&#x2019;s been on edge. But it&#x2019;s only three o&#x2019;clock in the afternoon. Maybe things will turn around.<br> <br>&#x201c;Come on, guys&#x2014;it&#x2019;s Eid,&#x201d; Bisma pleads. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t you be nice to each other today?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;She should be nice. Jam&#x2019;s always mean to me!&#x201d; Aleeza shakes her finger at me, and her eyes fill up.<br> <br>So much for things turning around. There&#x2019;s no way to sugarcoat it: My youngest sister is spoiled rotten. Aleeza&#x2019;s only ten, but that doesn&#x2019;t stop her from bossing around Bisma, who&#x2019;s a year older than her. And it doesn&#x2019;t matter to her that I&#x2019;m thirteen and in middle school. Aleeza doesn&#x2019;t respect me like she should.<br> <br>&#x201c;Jameela!&#x201d; Mama calls to me from the kitchen. &#x201c;Can you go down and get the nice napkins? From the garage?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay.&#x201d; I&#x2019;d rather face the lizards in the garage than listen to Aleeza whine for a second longer. Ever since Bisma saw a baby gecko scamper along the walls and freaked out like it had escaped from Jurassic Park, I&#x2019;m the only one of us girls who dares to go in there alone.<br> <br>The air inside the garage is suffocating, which isn&#x2019;t surprising, since it feels like five hundred degrees outside. This year Eid fell in August, the hottest month of the summer. Today also happens to be the kind of record-breaking scorcher of a day that earns Atlanta the nickname Hotlanta.<br> <br>The jumbo pack of napkins is on a crowded shelf, next to a box marked &#x201c;JAMEELA&#x2019;S STUFF: PRIVATE!!!&#x201d; where I&#x2019;ve stored my old journals and collection of last year&#x2019;s middle school newspapers. I was the only sixth grader who was an assistant editor and had an article in every issue of the paper, so I saved two copies of each. I resist the urge to carry the box inside so I can reread them, savoring each word like I want to.<br> <br>Out of the corner of my eye I spot a lizard, frozen in place near the garage door opener. I decide it&#x2019;s going to be the subject of a future article in the Mirza Memos, the family newspaper I&#x2019;ve been writing since I was nine years old. Maybe I&#x2019;ll research whether geckos have ever harmed humans, or how to get over the fear of creatures that resemble tiny alligators. If that includes hypnosis, I hope my sisters will let me try it out on them.<br> <br>I make sure my box isn&#x2019;t at risk of getting crushed by the endless stream of things that flow out of our town house into the garage. Then I grab a stack of napkins and head upstairs to the kitchen. Mama is arranging mini samosas on a platter, while Maryam cuts the raspberry bars she made into neat squares.<br> <br>&#x201c;Can you put those on the table with this fruit?&#x201d; Mama&#x2019;s brow furrows as she eyes the simple cotton shalwar kameez I threw on for Eid prayers earlier. &#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t you going to change into your new clothes?&#x201d;<br> <br>This morning I hit my snooze button over and over, which left no time to iron the bright green outfit with sparkly gold thread work I&#x2019;d left crumpled on my floor after trying it on last week. All I needed was a big star on my head, and I would have looked exactly like a walking Christmas tree decorated with tinsel. But since Mama&#x2019;s cousin in Pakistan had sent me the outfit, and because I knew it must have been expensive, I pretended to like it.<br> <br>&#x201c;Please say you will,&#x201d; Maryam adds. My older sister is elegant in her silvery-gray outfit with black embroidery. Her makeup, perfected after hours of watching tutorials on YouTube, is flawless. She&#x2019;s wearing a high bun, with wisps of loosened hairs that frame her cheekbones. As she bats her dark lashes at me, I squint at her, trying to tell if they&#x2019;re fake. She looks older than fifteen, and is glamorous.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s too hot for silk. Who&#x2019;s coming over, anyway?&#x201d; I tuck a curl that escaped my ponytail behind my ear and try not to think about how my rolled-out-of-bed look compares to Maryam&#x2019;s. &#x201c;Why do we need to impress them with fancy napkins?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Uncle Saeed. He&#x2019;s bringing his nephew. I&#x2019;m just trying to make it special for Eid,&#x201d; Mama says.<br> <br>I perk up when I hear &#x201c;Uncle Saeed.&#x201d; He&#x2019;s Baba&#x2019;s best friend, and our dentist.

He&#x2019;s holding a light blue box in his outstretched arms, and beads of sweat have already formed on his forehead. &#x201c;Something sugary for the sweetest of days.&#x201d; Uncle often speaks as if he&#x2019;s quoting a Hallmark card.<br> <br>&#x201c;Eid Mubarak.&#x201d; I take the box and scan the label. Yes! It&#x2019;s from Sugar Kisses Bakery. Mama thinks it&#x2019;s overpriced and refuses to take us there.

Or weddings. Or Eid. If I were wearing my tinsel-tree getup, I&#x2019;m sure I&#x2019;d hear &#x201c;Oh mashallah, today you look nice,&#x201d; no matter how uncomfortable or sweaty I felt.

That, along with the way he&#x2019;s shielding his eyes from the bright light, makes it seem like he could be posing for the cover of my mom&#x2019;s glossy South Asian lifestyle magazine, Libas. I almost want to laugh.<br> <br>&#x201c;Asalaamualaikum,&#x201d; he says to me, extending his hand like a grown-up, although he can&#x2019;t be much older than me. &#x201c;Pleasure to meet you.&#x201d; Ali&#x2019;s accent is definitely British, and his voice is deeper than I expected it to be.<br> <br>&#x201c;Wa&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. waalaikum asalaam,&#x201d; I stammer as his dark eyes pierce mine. Suddenly I have another vision of how disheveled I must appear, and my cheeks heat up from more than the hot sun.

Hillerman received every major honor for mystery fiction, including in 2008 the Western Writers of America's Wister Award for Lifetime Achievement. He served as president of the prestigious Mystery Writers of America and was honored with that group's Edgar Award and as one of mystery fiction's Grand Masters. In 2001 his memoir, <i>Seldom Disappointed</i>, won both the Anthony and Agatha Awards for best nonfiction. </p><p><b>Chapter One</b></p><p>At first, Officer Jim Chee had felt foolish sitting on the roof of the house of some total stranger. But that uneasiness had soon faded. Now this vantage point on the roof had come to seem one of Cowboy Dashee's rare good ideas. Chee could see almost everywhere from here. The drummers directly beneath the tips of his freshly shined boots, the column of masked dancers just entering the plaza to his left, the crowd of spectators jammed along the walls of the buildings, the sales booths lining the narrow streets beyond, he looked down on all of it. And out over the flat crowded roofs of Tano Pueblo, he could rest his eyes on the ragged row of cottonwoods along the river, golden today with autumn, or upon the blue mountains blocking the horizon, or the greentan-silver patchwork of farm fields the Tanoans irrigated. </p><p>It was an excellent perch from which to witness the Tanoan kachina dance--for duty as well as pleasure. Especially with the warm, jeans-clad thigh of Janet Pete pressed against him. If Delmar Kanitewa was present, Chee would be likely to see him. If the boy didn't show up, then there was no better place from which to watch the ceremonial. Such mystical rituals had always fascinated Chee. Since boyhood Chee had wanted to follow Hosteen Frank Sam Nakai. In the Navajo family structure Nakai was Chee's "Little Father," his mother's elder brother. Nakai was a shaman of the highest order. He was a <i>hataalii</i>--what the whites called a singer, or medicine man. He was respected for his knowledge of the traditional religion and of the curing ways the Holy People had taught to keep humankind in harmony with the reality that surrounds us all. Nakai worked along that narrow line that separates flesh and spirit. Since boyhood, that had interested Chee. </p><p>"On the roof is where they like visitors to sit when they're having a kachina dance," Dashee had said. "It gets you tourists out from underfoot. Unless you fall off, there's a lot less chance you'll do something stupid and mess up </p><p>the ceremony. And it leaves room around the dance ground for the Tano people. They need to exchange gifts with the kachinas. Things like that." </p><p>Dashee was a sworn deputy sheriff of Apache County, Arizona, a Hopi of his people's ancient Side Corn Clan, and Jim Chee's closest friend. But he could also be a pain in the butt. </p><p>"But what if I spot the kid?" Chee had asked. "Is he going to wait while I climb down?" </p><p>"Why not? He won't know you're looking for him." Cowboy had then leaned against Janet Pete and confided in a stage whisper, "The boy'll think Detective Chee would be over there in Thoreau working on that big homicide. " </p><p>"You know," Asher Davis said, "I'll bet I know that guy. There was a teacher at that Saint Bonaventure School--one of those volunteers--who called me a time or two to see if I could get a good price for something some old-timer had to sell. One time it was a little silver pollen container--looked late nineteenth century--and some jerk in Farmington had offered this old man two dollars for it. I got him two hundred and fifty. I wonder if that was the teacher who got killed." </p><p>"His name was Dorsey," Chee said, sounding slightly grouchy. He didn't know Davis and wasn't sure he'd like him. But maybe that was just the mood he was in. </p><p>"Dorsey," Davis said. "That's him." </p><p>"See?" Cowboy said. "Officer Chee keeps up on those serious crimes. And he also has time to write letters to the editor telling the Tano council what to do with its old uranium mines." </p><p>Chee had been ignoring Dashee's needling all morning. At first it had been based on the letter, published in that morning's edition of the <i>Navajo Times.</i> In it, Chee had opposed a proposal to use the open pit of the abandoned Jacks Wild Mine as a toxic waste dump. He had called it "symbolic of the contempt felt for tribal lands." But then they had heard of the homicide on the car radio. A school shop teacher at Thoreau had been hit fatally on the head. Some materials were reported missing and no suspect had been identified. It was a pretty good murder by reservation standards. Certainly it was more dignified than this assignment. It had happened yesterday, on Chee's day off. Still, Lieutenant Leaphorn might have assigned him to work on it. Or at least mentioned it. But he hadn't, and that burned a little. </p><p>What burned more was Janet. Janet had encouraged Cowboy's needling with amused grins and occasional chuckles. </p><p>But now, warmed by her praise of his letter, Chee was willing to forgive all that--even to feel better about Cowboy. He had to concede that he had started the exchange by kidding Cowboy about the Hopi tendency to grow wide, instead of high. And he had to concede that what Cowboy had said about the roof was true enough. If Kanitewa was down there In the crowd watching his pueblo celebrate this autumn feast day, the boy would be feeling secure among family and friends. But, on the other hand, kids who run away from boarding school know someone will be coming after them. </p><p>Chee had been just such a kid himself, once. That feeling of fear, of being hunted, was one he could never forget. You can't relax even when, as in Chee's case, the hunt was brief and there was little time for the fear to build. The man from the boarding school had been parked out of sight behind the sheep pens, waiting, when Chee had walked up to his mother's hogan. Seeing him had been almost a relief.</p></p><h2>I&#39;m a Lebowski, You&#39;re a Lebowski</h2><p><p>LOOK INSIDE THE BOOK <br>First released in 1998, the Coen brothers' <i>The Big Lebowski</i> flopped at the box office. But over the past nine years the movie has developed a massive and passionate cult following, led by the creation of Lebowski Fest, a traveling festival of all things Lebowski. Held in a bowling alley, it features bowling, costume and trivia contests, live music, a screening of the movie, White Russians, and what-haveyou. Attendance has grown exponentially and the Fest has been featured in virtually every national media outlet, from NPR to the New York Times. The Associated Press called it "kind of a 'Star Trek' convention, but without all the geeks." The Wall Street Journal simply intoned: "One hell of a party!" Now, at last, comes the book that the legion of Lebowski fans (aka Achievers) has been waiting for. <br><i>I'm a Lebowski, You're a Lebowski </i>is a treasure trove of trivia and commentary, hilarious throughout and copiously illustrated, including stills from the film, as well as dozens of photos taken on the set by Jeff Bridges. It includes interviews with virtually every major and minor cast member, as well as the real-life individuals who served as inspiration for the characters in the movie. The book features a handy guide to speaking Achiever (example: in English you would say that a woman is "feminine, or ladylike"; an Achiever would call her "strongly vaginal"), tips on how to Dude-ify your car, office, and living space, Lebowski Fest highlights, and so much more.</p></p><p><p><b>Bill Green </b>is a graphic designer and the poster artist for Lebowski Fest. <b>Ben Peskoe</b> is a Web developer and a writer. <b>Will Russell</b>, a magician, and <b>Scott Shuffitt</b>, an artist, are the Founding Dudes of Lebowski Fest.</p>If you recognize the phrase I don't roll on Shabbos or The Dude abides, then you've seen <i>The Big Lebowski</i>, filmmakers Joel and Ethan Coen's tribute to the detective genre starring Jeff Bridges as a bowling-loving stoner named The Dude who accidentally gets mixed up with kidnappers, nihilists and other strange Coen brother&#x2013;style comic types. A financial and critical bomb released in 1998, it has since gained a devoted cult following, due in no small part to the efforts of this delightfully obsessive book's authors, the organizers of Lebowski Fest, a traveling celebration that combines the good vibes of a Grateful Dead concert with the fervor of a Star Trek convention. Like a typical Dead concert, however, the book is a lot of fun, but will seem uneven to all but the hardest-core fan. Highlights include insightful interviews with principal actors, including Bridges and John Goodman (I think that's the favorite thing I've ever done in my life). Unfortunately, the authors also feature various unsuccessful attempts at capturing the film's quirky humor (How to Dude-ify Your Car) along with too many long and repetitious interviews with various Lebowski fanatics. <i>(Sept.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

What if we treated religious tracts, including the Bible, as empirical evidence of the supernatural world? Karl Ove Knausgaard&#39;s major novel, A Time For Everything, is about God and his angels. It posits that angels are real, and that God exists. It posits, further, that heavenly beings evolve, and that even God may be subject to change. Written with Knausgaard&#39;s characteristic style - level, patient, and intensely readable - it is a dazzling and innovative examination of the relationships between human, angels and God. Knausgaard&#39;s novel A Time For Everything was originally published by Portobello as A Time to Every Purpose Under Heaven. The book is now restored to its original structure in a new edition which is faithful to the original text</p><p>KARL OVE KNAUSGAARD was born in Norway in 1968 and made his debut with Out of This World. This, his second novel, was nominated for the Nordic Council Prize, and was his first to be translated into English. He is the author of the six volume autobiographical novel My Struggle, an international bestseller.Antinous had been born in 1551 at Ardo, a small mountain town in the far north of Italy, where in all likelihood he remained until he began to study in 1565. Apart from one particular event, to which he was to return time after time for the rest of his life, little is known about his early years. The names of his parents and native town do not figure anywhere in Antinous&#x2019;s writings, and, as they are otherwise characterized by a large amount of biographical detail, this early obscurity has aroused the curiosity of many readers. But if one is to attempt to understand Antinous, it isn&#x2019;t to the inner man one must turn.</p><h2>It&#39;s Raining Frogs and Fishes: Four Seasons of Natural Phenomena and Oddities of the Sky</h2><p>An introduction to unusual natural curiosities in the sky covers rainbows, meteors, tornadoes, and the northern lights, among other phenomenon</p><p><i>It's Raining Frogs and Fishes</i>, a lighthearted look at the world's weather, collects oddments and tidbits on climatological matters.

Tracing the background of this enticing film genre from the influences of Chinese opera to the mixture of fantasy and fast-paced action of the present day style, this is essential reading for both the intrigued layman and the die-hard Hong Kong fan. Photos, 95 in color.</p><p>This is the most colorful and entertaining history of Hong Kong action cinema available. Bey Logan traces the genre from its genesis in the late 1940s until the 1990s, enhancing his story with biographies, select filmographies, and 10-best lists. Though Logan focuses on superstars such as Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan, and John Woo, he also takes time to describe how Hong Kong action cinema blends with other genres. He devotes chapters of his book to Hong Kong comedy, horror, and fantasy as well as to the series of action films that feature female protagonists. Logan concludes the book by looking toward the future of this cinema and the &#34;New Dragons Rising&#34; who could be its next stars.Followers of Hong Kong films know what action really is. The balletic, often violent, frequently absurd but always imaginative and entertaining cinematic output of that tiny island is leaping and chopping its way into the West, and Logan's book does an excellent job of clueing new followers into what's what and who's who in the Hong Kong action scene. Many of the top chop-socky stars, such as Jackie Chan, come from the rigorous classical training of Peking Opera, where actors are required not only to sing but also to tumble, dance and fight with traditional weapons. Logan shows how the popular story of 19th-century martial-arts hero Wong Fei Hung was blended with equally popular Peking Opera action to launch a new movie style in the late 1940s and how that style has exploded since then. Although most of the Hong King films shown in the U.S. are police action flicks, some of the nuttiest are the ghost stories and fantastical-historical reenactments of events from the semi-legendary past, many of which are given their due here. Author Bey (who has appeared in a number of Hong Kong films and is the editor of Combat magazine) covers the leading actors, the fighting females (who are rarely just romantic interests) and the transition that directors such as John Woo and Tsui Hark are making to Western studios?where many of the stunts copied from their films preceded them. For the reader just discovering Hong Kong cinema, this book is an excellent guide. For the old hand, it offers juicy tidbits on the past and present of this exciting and increasingly popular genre. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>A Pictorial Guide to Fossils</h2><p>Until now, locating a reference that identifies and classifies fossils found around the world has been harder than uncovering the finds themselves.

The Boston Tea Party is a familiar tale, but the story leading up to it goes beyond the drama of that one night. Pamela Duncan Edwards&#39; unique take on this event gets to the root of the story as this prelude to the Revolutionary War unfolds. Enhanced by English and colonial mice characters, Henry Cole&#39;s rich and mood-evoking illustrations bring the story to life.</p><p>Pamela Duncan Edwards has teamed up with Henry Cole on over a dozen picture books, earning such honors as the California Young Readers' Medal for <i>Livingstone Mouse</i>, starred reviews for <i>Warthogs in the Kitchen</i>, Honk! <i>The Story of Prima Swanerina</i>, and <i>Barefoot</i>, and AMA Pick of the Lists for<i> Four Famished Foxes and Forsdyke</i>. Originally from England, she was a children's librarian for many years. She lives with her husband in Virginia.<br><br>Henry Cole is a self-taught artist with a degree in forestry. He was an elementary school science teacher for many years in Virginia. He now lives in Washington, D.C.The creators of Livingstone Mouse and Warthogs in the Kitchen travel back to 1773, when King George III's export tax on tea precipitated the Boston Tea Party. Ably targeting her audience, Edwards pares down the historical data. The narrative unspools in a singsong imitation of "The House That Jack Built," which plays up the irony of the king's tax on tea from India being sold to the colonies. The opening spread shows women in India picking tea leaves, followed soon after by a caricature of the king at teatime. Later, as outraged colonists read a notice of the new tax, the text incorporates the events thus far: "These are the colonists who cried, `No!' to the king on his English throne who declared, `Tax the tea!' that was made from the leaves that grew on a bush in a far-off land and became part of the Boston Tea Party." At the bottom of each spread, a bevy of chatty mice comment on the goings-on, offering supplementary information ("We're not going to take it! `No taxation without representation!' ") as well as light asides ("Make sure you don't dump any cheese by mistake!"). Rendered in acrylic paints and colored pencils, Cole's lifelike paintings effectively evoke the period setting on both sides of the Atlantic. This early history lesson goes down easily, and will likely lead readers to find out more about this pivotal event in the formation of America.

I will be releasing an expanded and updated version that will include new information and author sketches of Seattle's pioneers and buildings from her earliest days.<br><i><br>Sweetbriar Summer</i> opens upon the controversial murder trials of Seattle's Third District Court. The remaining story is the consequence of what happened at those trials. Because I've been so exacting in my study of the Boren and Denny families and feel like I know their characters well, it's been a longtime puzzle for me as to why contemporary texts like to point out that during those trials Arthur Denny and David Denny--for the one and only time in their lives--voted against their consciences. In my research of untold documents and manuscripts and published texts, I'd not come across anything that remotely suggested these men had EVER ignored their consciences. The closest reference I could find to the fact that they may have came from Arthur Denny's granddaughter, Roberta Frye Watt. In her very accurate history, FOUR WAGONS WEST, Ms. Watt reported that Arthur and David had both served on the trial juries. Yet there were several trials, and she did not make any statement as to WHICH of those juries David and Arthur might have sat on. Had historians simply jumped to the wrong conclusions? And subsequent writers, taking the wrong cues, perpetuated a myth? <i>Sweetbriar Summer</i> is cornerstoned on these trials. I, therefore, could not begin writing until I'd resolved once and for all whether or not David and Arthur--both of whom I'd learned to trust in regard to their integrity--had, indeed, been guilty of ignoring the truth. My suspicion was that they had not. But if they had, I wanted to know what internal struggle had led these men into making a decision that was so uncharacteristic of their personalities and faith. <br> My search took me many interesting places. I finally found help at the Puget Sound branch of Washington State Archives in Seattle, Washington, housed in a few back rooms of a terribly dilapidated and abandoned junior high school. There, the librarian unearthed for me the King County Court Journals of 1854. And there, written in antiquated script and faded ink, were the jury lists. Everyone's names--and the trials under which they served. <br> It is my hope that with the publication of <i>Sweetbriar Summer</i> the truth of those trials--and the men involved--can now be made clear.</p><h2>Shelter in the Garden, A: Playhouses, Treehouses, Gazebos, Sheds, and Other Outdoor Structures</h2><p>Whether it&#x2019;s a treehouse perched among the branches or a rustic gazebo by a pond, a small-scale playhouse or a whimsical dovecote, shelters in the garden conjure thoughts of childhood and long-ago summers. <i>A Shelter in the Garden</i> inspires readers to re-create these bygone days by constructing their own outdoor features: arbors and pergolas, greenhouses and potting sheds, tiny cottages and canopied cabanas, birdhouses and birdfeeders. &nbsp;With 175 photographs of shelters in beautiful garden and backyard settings, this book showcases a huge array of ideas for outdoor projects, some largely decorative, others more utilitarian.

They have to leave their home and escape to another country on a frightening journey by car and boat. In the new country they must learn to speak a new language, find a new home and Azzi must start a new school. With a kind helper at the school, Azzi begins to learn English and understand that she is not the only one who has had to flee her home. She makes a new friend, and with courage and resourcefulness, begins to adapt to her new life. But Grandma has been left behind and Azzi misses her more than anything. Will Azzi ever see her grandma again? Drawing on her own experience of working among refugee families, renowned author and illustrator Sarah Garland tells, with tenderness and humour, an exciting adventure story to be enjoyed by readers of all ages.<br><br>Endorsed by Amnesty International.<br></p><p><b>Sarah Garland</b> is a much-loved author/illustrator who has published more than 40 books. The daughter of a publisher and illustrator, she trained as a typographer at the London College of Printing. She has written many books for children, and also books for adults on herbs and their uses. During her childhood in the New Forest and in recent years she has concentrated on growing a very wide variety of herbs to use in her kitchen, and to treat minor ailments.<br><br>She lives in Chedworth, Gloucestershire, U.K.&nbsp;Her books for Frances Lincoln are <i>Eddie's Garden</i> and <i>Eddie's Kitchen; Going to Playschool, Doing the Garden, Going Swimming, Coming to Tea, Doing the Shopping, Doing Christmas, Having a Picnic</i> and <i>Doing the Washing; Billy and Belle; Dashing Dog; Splash</i> and <i>Zoom</i>.Gr 2&#x2013;5&#x2014;"There was a country at war, and that is where this story begins." Thus starts a tale that is both universal and specific, in which Azzi, a sweet and unique little girl serves as an everychild representing all refugees. The narrative follows her family's escape, arduous journey, and difficulties settling into their new land and ends with hope for a peaceful and loving new life. The countries are never named and the peoples' ethnicities not specified, allowing the focus to remain squarely on the realistic emotional dynamics. The story is told simply and touchingly in an approachable way that will evoke empathy in young readers. This is as much an effect of the graphic-novel style illustrations as of the text; both elements combine to create a reassuring atmosphere for the serious topic. The felt-tip and watercolor artwork echoes the friendly style of Aliki or Anita Lobel, even in the scenes of Azzi's war-torn homeland. There are no depictions of graphic violence, just a general sense of disruption and displacement. This book should be widely shared. Adults will have to judge whether younger readers are ready for it, and may have to help older readers to accept it, but this beautifully told, emotionally true story is worth promoting.&#x2014;Heidi Estrin, Congregation B'nai Israel, Boca Raton, FL</p><h2>Literature as Opera</h2><p>The author examines the fascinating circumstances in which composers have found works of literature suitable for opera, &amp; how they have transmuted into musical &amp; dramatic terms the essential features of works that in some cases may not ever have been plays.

Poverty and debt push many towards piracy and drugs&#x2015;although the criminality linked to the industry extends far beyond any individual worker, vessel, or fleet. <i>Fishers and Plunderers </i>provides strong evidence of industry-wide crimes and injustices and argues for regulations that protect the rights of fishers across the board.</p><p>Marwan Darweish is Senior Lecturer at the Centre for Peace and Reconciliation Studies (CPRS) at Coventry University.

From that point on, his life is driven by the need to find out what happened to the Vanished Vatchers. His father, Edgar, born to a poor family of fishermen, had risen to become the right-hand man to the colony's prime minister, then suffered an unexpected fall from grace. Were he and his wife murdered? Was it suicide? Had they run away? If so, why had they left their only child behind? <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ned soon finds himself enmeshed in another family, that of his missing father and the poverty from which the man somehow escaped. His grandparents, Nan and Reg, his Uncle Cyril and others, are themselves haunted by the inexplicable disappearance of a third Vatcher, a young man who was lost at sea on a calm and sunny day years earlier. Two other people loom large as Ned becomes Newfoundland's first media mogul, building an empire to insulate him from loss: a Jesuit priest named Father Duggan, and Sheilagh Fielding, a boozy giantess who, while wandering the city streets at night, composes satiric columns that scandalize the rich and powerful. In Ned, Fielding sees a surrogate for her two lost children, the secret that dogs her life, while Ned believes the enigmatic Fielding to be his soulmate. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The novel builds to a spectacular resolution of the mystery of all the Vanished Vatchers.

Metamorphosing the most familiar subjects into a quasi-surrealist world, their creations, amassed over the last 35 years, bear witness to two of the most original artistic imaginations at work today in France.<br><br>While Claude imagines a fabulous and intimate world where crocodiles entwine the backs of chairs, cabbages sprout legs and feet, and apples break into a smile, Fran�ois-Xavier produces full-size, articulated beasts in metal-- a rhino which doubles as a secretaire, a hippo bathtub, a gorilla safe....Associated originally with the Nouveaux R�alistes of 1960s Paris, the Lalannes have developed individual but related styles. The works of both artists describe a freedom from the classifications, as well as from the physical spaces of the artistic academy. Designed for living in and around, certain sculptures form landscapes which find echoes in French gardens of the eighteenth century, in Art Nouveau organic structures, and even in the illusions of scale found in modern theme parks.

He makes his home in Hilton Head, South Carolina.Super-agent/assassin Paul Bannerman returns from semi-retirement in suburbia to confront hoodlums exploiting the chaos in post-Soviet Russia. A gang of rogue KGB agents and cartoonishly brutal Russian mobsters aims to take advantage of the vacuum of authority through an arms-for-drugs-and-hard-currency scheme. Tired of seeing his troubled nation further weakened, KGB agent Leonid Belkin decides to import Bannerman and his uncanny talent for making trouble "disappear." Belkin does this by inviting a former associate, Elena Brugg, to Moscow for a honeymoon with her new husband Raymond Lesko, who is Bannerman's father-in-law. Trouble ensues when Lesko is mistakenly pinned to the murder of one of the mobsters on the KGB payroll. Bannerman, the bad guys, and other KGB and CIA types flown in from around the globe eventually converge on Moscow, just in time for a gory free-for-all. Although a number of scenes convincingly evoke Russia's current malaise, Maxim's ( Bannerman's Law ) labor ultimately yields little more than a turgid, artlessly rendered techno-thriller in which many characters appear to do so much with so little reason. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>A Dream for Tomorrow (Volume 2) (Homeward on the Oregon Trail)</h2><p><p>Bestselling author Melody Carlson (more than 5 million books sold) continues her Homeward on the Oregon Trail series with this second romantic adventure.</p><p>Elizabeth Martin and her two children have made it through the easy part of their journey, but now their wagon train faces high mountain passes, dangerous river crossings, and decreasing supplies.

Each of these realms of knowledge, as well as Day's adept storytelling skills, comes into play in this fresh interpretation of the legend of King Arthur. Day carefully sorts facts from fancy as he traces the historical roots of King Arthur to the fifth-century champion Artorius Dux Bellorum and then analyzes the social and political forces that turned him into one of the "world's most popular heroes." Day retells many key Arthurian legends, paying special attention to Merlin the Magician, reputed to be the prophetic and supernatural offspring of a virgin nun and a demon, and the source of the mystical aura surrounding the tales of King Arthur. Day's illuminating and thoroughly enjoyable narrative is enhanced by more than 170 luscious full-color illustrations by such celebrated artists as Gustave Doreand Arthur Rackham as well as contemporary illustrator Alan Lee. The only complaint is that these artists are credited in a list at the back of the book. Captions would have been much more appropriate. <i>Donna Seaman</i>YA?Beginning with Artorius the Dux Bellorum, Lord of Battles, Day weaves fact and myth, politics and religion, literature and art into a readable, entertaining, structured account that breathes life into the Arthurian legends. Dragons, Merlin, Morgan Le Fay, the Lady of the Lake, Excalibur, Camelot, the Round Table, Guinevere and Lancelot, the quest for the Holy Grail, the Last Battle, and the Isle of Avalon are all traced and put into historical context. Over 170 reproductions, many of them works by Arthur Rackham, Alan Lee, Walter Crane, and Aubrey Beardsley, provide a visual history of Arthurian illustration.

FOR AMERICA'S SAKE</b><br><i><br>A New Story for America</i><br>December 12, 2006<br><i>My father dropped out of the fourth grade and never returned to school because his family needed him to pick cotton to help make ends meet. The Great Depression knocked him down and almost out. When I was born he was making $2 a day working on the highway to Oklahoma City. He never took home more than $100 a week in his working life, and he made that only when he joined the union in the last job he held. He voted for Franklin Roosevelt in four straight elections and would have gone on voting for him until kingdom come if he'd had the chance. I once asked him why, and he said, "Because he was my friend." My father of course never met FDR; no politician ever paid him much note. Many years later when I wound up working in the White House my parents came for a visit and my father asked to see the Roosevelt Room. I don't quite know how to explain it, except that my father knew who was on his side. When FDR died my father wept; he had lost his friend. This man with a fourth-grade education understood what the patrician in the White House meant when he talked about "economic royalism" and how private power no less than public power can bring America to ruin in the absence of democratic controls. When the president said "the malefactors of great wealth" had concentrated into their own hands "an almost complete control over other people's property, other people's money, other people's labor, and other people's lives," my father said amen; he believed the president knew what life was like for people like him. When the president said life was no longer free, liberty no longer real, men could no longer follow the pursuit of happiness against "economic tyranny such as this," my father nodded. He got it when Roosevelt said that a government by money was as much to be feared as a government by mob, and that the political equality we once had was meaningless in the face of economic inequality. Against organized wealth, FDR said that "the American citizen could appeal only to the organized power of government." My father knew the president meant him.<br><br>Today my father would be written out of America's story. He would belong to what the sociologist Katherine Newman calls the "missing class"*--the fifty-seven million Americans who occupy an obscure place between the rungs of our social ladder, earning wages above the minimum but below a secure standard of living. They work hard for their $20,000 to $40,000 a year, and they are vital to the functioning of the country, as transit workers, day-care providers, hospital attendants, teachers' aides, clerical assistants. They live one divorce, one pink slip, one illness away from a free fall. Largely forgotten by the press, politicians, and policy makers who fashion government safety nets, they have no nest egg, no income but the next paycheck, no way of paying for their children to go to college. Over the years I have chronicled the lives of some of these people in my documentaries. Now, a few days after the election of 2006, I was asked to speak at a conference sponsored by </i>The Nation,<i> the Brennan Center for Justice, the New Democracy Project, and Demos to discuss the prospects of democracy. Those prospects are dim, I realized, unless we write a story of America that includes those people who are living on the edge, with no friend in the White House.</i><br>***<br><br>You could not have chosen a better time to gather. Voters have provided a respite from a right-wing radicalism predicated on the philosophy that extremism in the pursuit of virtue is no vice. It seems only yesterday that the Trojan horse of conservatism was hauled into Washington to disgorge Newt Gingrich, Tom DeLay, Ralph Reed, Grover Norquist, and their band of ravenous predators masquerading as a political party of small government, fiscal restraint, and moral piety and promising "to restore accountability to Congress...(and) make us all proud again of the way free people govern themselves."<br><br>Well, the long night of the cabal is over, and Democrats are ebullient as they prepare to take charge of the multitrillion-dollar influence racket that we used to call the U.S. Congress. Let them rejoice while they can, as long as they remember that they have arrived at this moment mainly because George W. Bush started a war most people have come to believe should never have been fought in the first place. Let them remember that although they are reveling in the ruins of a Republican reign brought down by stupendous scandals, their own closet is stocked with skeletons from an era when they were routed from office following ABSCAM bribes and savings and loan swindles that plucked the pockets and purses of hardworking Americans. As they rejoice Democrats would be wise to be mindful of Shakespeare's counsel: "Merit doth much, but fortune more." For they were delivered from the wilderness not by their own goodness but by the hubris of the party in power--a recurring phenomenon of American democracy.<br><br>Whatever one might say about the 2006 election, the real story is one that our political and media elites are loath to acknowledge or address. I am not speaking of the lengthy list of priorities that progressives and liberals are eager to put on the table now that Democrats hold the cards in Congress. The other day a message popped up on my computer from a progressive advocate who is committed to movement building from the ground up and has results to show for his labors. His request was simple: "With changes in Congress and at our state capitol, we want your input on what top issues our lawmakers should tackle. Click here to submit your top priority."<br><br>I clicked. Up came a list of thirty-four issues&#x2014;an impressive list that began with "African American" and ran alphabetically through "energy" and "guns," to "higher education" "transportation," "women's issues," and "worker's rights." It wasn't a list to be dismissed by any means, for it came from an unrequited thirst for action after a long season of fierce opposition to every aspiration on the agenda. I understand the mind-set. Here's a fellow who values allies and appreciates what it takes to build coalitions; who knows that although our interests as citizens vary, each one is an artery to the heart that pumps life through the body politic, and each is important to the health of democracy. This is an activist who knows political success is the sum of many parts.<br><br>But America needs something more right now than a "must-do" list from liberals and progressives. America needs a different story.<br><br>The very morning I read the message from the progressive activist, <i>The New York Times</i> reported on Carol Ann Reyes. She is sixty-three, lives in Los Angeles, suffers from dementia, and is homeless. Somehow she made her way to a hospital with serious, untreated needs. No details were provided as to what happened to her there, except that the hospital called a cab and sent her back to skid row. True, they phoned ahead to workers at a rescue shelter to let them know she was coming. But some hours later a surveillance camera picked her up "wandering around the streets in a hospital gown and slippers." Dumped in America.<br><br>Here is the real political story, the one most politicians won't even acknowledge: the reality of the anonymous, disquieting daily struggle of ordinary people, including not only the most marginalized and vulnerable Americans but also young workers, elders and parents, families and communities, searching for dignity and fairness against long odds in an amoral market world.<br><br>Everywhere you turn you'll find people who believe they have been written out of the story. Everywhere you turn there's a sense of insecurity grounded in a gnawing fear that freedom in America has come to mean the freedom of the rich to get richer even as millions of Americans are thrown overboard. So let me say what I think up front: the leaders and thinkers and activists who honestly tell that story and speak passionately of the moral and religious values it puts in play will be the first political generation since the New Deal to win power back for the people.<br><br>There's no mistaking America is ready for change. One of our leading analysts of public opinion, Daniel Yankelovich, reports that a majority want social cohesion and common ground based on pragmatism and compromise, patriotism and diversity. But because of the great disparities in wealth the "shining city on the hill" has become a gated community whose privileged occupants, surrounded by moats of money and protected by a political system seduced with cash into subservience, are removed from the common life of the country.<br><br>The wreckage of this revolt of elites is all around us. Corporations are shredding the social compact, pensions are disappearing, medium incomes are flattening, and health-care costs are soaring. In many ways, the average household is generally worse off today than it was thirty years ago, and the public sector that improved life for millions of Americans across three generations is in tatters. For a time, stagnating wages were somewhat offset by more work and more personal debt. Both political parties craftily refashioned those major renovations of the average household as the new standard, shielding employers from responsibility for anything Wall Street would not reward. Now, however, the more acute major risks workers have been forced to bear as employers reduce their health and retirement costs have reveal that gains made by people who live paycheck to paycheck are being reversed. Polls show a majority of American workers now believe their children will be worse off than they were. In one recent survey, only 14 percent of workers said that they have obtained the American dream.<br><br>It is hard to believe that less than four decades ago a key architect of the antipoverty program, Robert Lampman, could argue that the "recent history of Western nations reveals an increasingly widespread adoption of the idea that substantial equality of social and economic conditions among individuals is a good thing." Economists call that postwar era the "Great Compression." Poverty and inequality had declined dramatically for the first time in our history. Here is how a Time magazine report summed up the national outlook in 1953: "Even in the smallest towns and most isolated areas, the U. S. is wearing a very prosperous, middle-class suit of clothes, and an attitude of relaxation and confidence. People are not growing wealthy, but more of them than ever before are getting along..."<br><br>African Americans were still written out of the story, but that was changing, too, as heroic resistance emerged across the South to awaken our national conscience. Within a decade, thanks to the civil rights movement and President Lyndon Johnson, the racial cast of many federal policies&#x2014;including some New Deal programs&#x2014;was aggressively repudiated, and shared prosperity began to breach the color line.<br><br>To this day I remember John F. Kennedy's landmark speech at the Yale commencement in 1962. Echoing Daniel Bell's cold war classic <i>The End of Ideology</i>, JFK proclaimed the triumph of "practical management of a modern economy" over the "grand warfare of rival ideologies." The problem with this is that the purported ideological cease-fire ended only a few years later. But the Democrats never rearmed. While "practical management of a modern economy" had a kind of surrogate legitimacy as long as it worked, when it no longer worked, the nation faced a paralyzing moral void in deciding how the burdens should be borne. Well-organized conservative forces, firing on all ideological pistons, rushed to fill this void with a story corporate America wanted us to hear. Inspired by bumper-sticker abstractions of Milton Friedman's ideas, propelled by cascades of cash from corporate chieftains like Coors and Koch and "Neutron" Jack Welch, fortified by the pious prescriptions of fundamentalist political preachers, the conservative armies marched on Washington. And they succeeded brilliantly.<br><br>When Ronald Reagan addressed the Republican National Convention in 1980, he told a simple political story with great impact. "The major issue of this campaign is the direct political, personal and moral responsibility of Democratic Party leadership&#x2014;in the White House and in Congress&#x2014;for this unprecedented calamity which has befallen us." He declared: "I will not stand by and watch this great country destroy itself." It was a speech of bold contrasts, of "good" private interest versus "bad" government, of course. More important, it personified these two forces in a larger narrative of freedom, reaching back across the Great Depression, the Civil War, and the American Revolution, all the way back to the Mayflower Compact. It dazzled his followers and so demoralized Democrats that they could not muster a response to the social costs that came with the Reagan revolution.<br><br>But there is another story of freedom to tell, and it, too, reaches back across the Great Depression, the Civil War, and the American Revolution, all the way back to the Mayflower Compact. It's a story with clear and certain foundations, like Reagan's, but also a tumultuous and sometimes violent history of betrayal that he and other conservatives consistently and conveniently ignore.<br><br>Reagan's story of freedom superficially alludes to the Founding Fathers, but its substance comes from the Gilded Age, devised by apologists for the robber barons. It is posed abstractly as the freedom of the individual from government control&#x2014;a Jeffersonian ideal at the root of our Bill of Rights, to be sure. But what it meant in politics a century later, and still means today, is the freedom to accumulate wealth without social or democratic responsibilities and the license to buy the political system right out from under everyone else, so that democracy no longer has the ability to hold capitalism accountable to notions of fairness and justice.<br><br>And that is not how freedom was understood when our country was founded. At the heart of our experience as a nation is the proposition that each citizen has a right to "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." As flawed in its reach as it was at the time, that proposition carries an inherent imperative:<br><br>Inasmuch as the members of a liberal society have a right to basic requirements of human development such as education and a minimum standard of security, they have obligations to each other, mutually and through their government, to ensure that conditions exist enabling every person to have the opportunity for success in life.<br><br>The quote comes directly from Paul Starr, whose book <i>Freedom's Power: The True Force of Liberalism</i> is a call for liberals to reclaim the idea of America's greatness as their own.<br><br>Starr's book is one of three that in a just world would be on every desk in the House and Senate when Congress convenes again.</p><h2>English Domestic Clocks</h2><p>This book is one of the classic works on British clockmaking and remains by far and away the best account of the development of the main types of clocks since the middle of the seventeenth century. Perhaps the secret of the book&#39;s success is that it was written by experts who were themselves keen collectors and, therefore, covered in depth the type of clocks available to collectors. They steered clear of the trap of discussing one-off historically interesting examples which collectors may never see and will certainly never own. They explained in lucid English just how clocks work, the results of the introduction of the pendulum, and the subsequent development of longcase (grandfather), bracket and lantern clocks. Generations of clock enthusiasts have learned to date a clock from the invaluable illustrated chronology of hands, dials, spandrels and to learn to judge the quality of a wide variety of clocks. It is, therefore, the ideal companion for anybody interested in the subject.</p><p></p><h2>Wildflowers of the Northern Great Plains, Third Edition</h2><p>A field guide to the wild flowers of western Canada and the adjoining Great Plains states of the United States, including illustrations of nearly 400 species.</p><p></p><h2>Colombia (Enchantment of the World)</h2><p><b>Learn about the country's history, culture, people and much more!</b><br><br>Colonized by Spanish explorers in the 15th century, Colombia has since grown to become a powerful independent nation with one of the most successful economies in South America.

His career spanned a lifetime, but for years he has remained hidden behind the persona he so vigorously generated, and so fiercely protected. Now, in this surprising, illuminating, and compulsively readable biography, we are taken beyond the icon, into the extraordinary, singular life of Sammy Davis, Jr. <br><br>In scrupulous detail and with stunning powers of evocation, Wil Haygood takes us back to the era of vaudeville, where it all began for four-year-old Sammy who ran out onstage one night and stole the show. From then on it was a motherless childhood on the road, singing and dancing his way across a segregated America with his father and the formidable showman Will Mastin, struggling together to survive the Depression and the demise of vaudeville itself. <br><br>With an ambition honed by poverty and an obsessive need for applause, Sammy drove his way into the nightclub circuit of the 1940s and 1950s, when, his father and Mastin aging and out of style, he slowly began to make a name for himself, hustling his way to top billing and eventually to recording contracts. From there, he was to stake his claim on Broadway, in Hollywood, and, of course, in Las Vegas. <br><br>Haygood brings Sammy&#x2019;s showbiz life into full relief against the backdrop of an America in the throes of racial change. Sammy grew up trapped between the worlds of blacks and whites, with so much invested in both. He made his living entertaining white people but was often denied service in the very venues he played. Drafted into a newly integrated U.S. Army in the 1940s, he saw up close the fierce tensions that seethed below the surface. Dragged into the civil rights movement, he witnessed a hatred that often erupted into violence. In his broad and varied friendships and alliances (with Frank Sinatra; Martin Luther King, Jr.; Richard Nixon; Sidney Poitier; Marilyn Monroe, to name just a few), not to mention his romances (his relationship with Kim Novak and his marriage to the blond beauty May Britt drew death threats), he forged uncharted paths across racial lines. Admired and reviled by both blacks and whites, he was tormented all his life by raging insecurities, and never quite came to terms with his own skin. Ultimately, his only true sense of his identity was as a performer.<br><br>Based on painstaking research and more than 250 interviews, Wil Haygood brings us a sweeping and vivid cultural history of the twentieth century, chronicling black entertainment from its beginnings and the birth of popular culture as we know it. <b>In Black and White</b> transcends simple biography to become an important record, both celebratory and elegiacal, of a vanished America and its greatest entertainer.</p><p>&#x201c;Reading this book is a very moving experience: because of the power of Wil Haygood&#x2019;s prose; because of the compassion with which he writes about his complex and tortured subject; and because of the penetrating historical insight &#x2014; indeed brilliance&#x2013;with which he weaves Sammy Davis Jr.&#x2019;s life and the poignant and fascinating story of black entertainment in America into the whole tragedy of race relations in our country. Mr. Haygood writes with great power and great compassion, and he has created a book that I couldn&#x2019;t put down and that I will never forget.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;Robert A. Caro<br>"In this moving, exhaustive life of one of America&#x2019;s greatest entertainers, Haygood (<i>King of the Cats: The Life and Times of Adam Clayton Powell Jr.</i>) casts Sammy Davis Jr. as a man shifting between identities, between the worlds of black people and white people." <br>&#x2013;Starred PW Review<br>"An American life considered with art and understanding in a major work of biography."<br>&#x2013;Starred Kirkus Reviews<br>"A fascinating American life story, brilliantly told."<br>&#x2013;Booklist, Starred and Boxed Review<br>"IN BLACK AND WHITE... presents a full picture of one of the most recognizable entertainers of the last century�--a picture with all the shades of gray.

Even though the dormitory is full, there's sure to be <i>somewhere</i> for them to sleep. </p> <p> It's important to be well rested for school -- or in case of an emergency. It's fortunate too that the siblings will have a chance to meet some other children. Even though some students are rude, or possibly a part of an evil scheme, there's hope that the Baudelaires will make some friends. A good friend can be a great help in a pinch. </p> <p> The children will even have the chance to take part in a unique athletic program. Even with a sketchy instructor, they will develop strong legs. Strong legs can come in handy for sports -- or to run for your life. </p> <p> With some good sleep, nice friends, a solid education, and strong legs, the Baudelaires will hopefully be as well prepared as they can -- just in case their time at school turns out to be another wretched episode in a series of unfortunate events. </p></p><p>As the three Baudelaire orphans warily approach their new home--Prufrock Preparatory School--they can't help but notice the enormous stone arch bearing the school's motto <i>Memento Mori</i>, or "Remember you will die." This is not a cheerful greeting, and certainly marks an inauspicious beginning to a very bleak story. Of course, this is what we have come to expect from Lemony Snicket's Series of Unfortunate Events, the deliciously morbid set of books that began with <i>The Bad Beginning</i> and only got worse.<p> In <i>The Austere Academy</i>, Violet, Klaus, and Sunny are at first optimistic--attending school is a welcome change for the book-loving trio, and the academy is allegedly safe from the dreaded Count Olaf, who is after their fortune. Hope dissipates quickly, however, when they meet Vice Principal Nero, a self-professed genius violinist who sneeringly imitates their every word. More dreadful still, he houses them in the tin Orphans Shack, crawling with toe-biting crabs and dripping with a mysterious tan fungus. A beam of light shines through the despair when the Baudelaires meet the Quagmires, two of three orphaned triplets who are no strangers to disaster and sympathize with their predicament. When Count Olaf appears on the scene disguised as Coach Genghis (covering his monobrow with a turban and his ankle tattoo with expensive running shoes), the Quagmires resolve to come to the aid of their new friends. Sadly, this proves to be a hideous mistake.</p><p> Snicket disarms us again with his playful juxtapositions--only he can compare bombs with strawberry shortcake (both are as dangerous to make as assumptions), muse on how babies adjust developmentally to the idea of curtains, or ponder why the Baudelaire orphans would not want to be stalks of celery despite their incessant bad luck as humans. We can't get enough of this splendid series of misadventures, and can only wager that swarms of young readers will be right next to us in line for the next installment.

In <i>Beyond the Architect's Eye</i>, Mary N. Woods expands on this range of images through a rich analysis that commingles art, amateur, and documentary photography, genres usually not considered architectural but that often take the built environment as their subject.</p><p>Woods explores how photographers used their built environment to capture the disparate American landscapes prior to World War II, when urban and rural areas grew further apart in the face of skyscrapers, massive industrialization, and profound cultural shifts. Central to this study is the work of Alfred Stieglitz, Frances Benjamin Johnston, and Marion Post Wolcott, but Woods weaves a wider narrative that also includes Alice Austen, Gertrude K�sebier, Berenice Abbott, Margaret Bourke-White, Helen Levitt, Lisette Model, Louise Dahl-Wolfe, Morgan and Marvin Smith, Eudora Welty, Samuel Gottscho, Walker Evans, Max Waldman, and others.</p><p>In such disparate places as New York City, the rural South, and the burgeoning metropolis of Miami, these unconventional architectural photographers observed buildings as deeply connected to their context. Whereas Stieglitz captured New York as the quintessential modern urban landscape in the period, the South was its opposite, a land supposedly frozen in the past. Yet just as this myth of the Old South crystallized in photographs like Johnston's, a New South shaped by popular culture and modern industry arose. Miami embodied both of these visions. In Wolcott's work, agricultural fields where stoop labor persisted were juxtaposed with Art Deco hotels, a popular modernism of the machine age that remade Miami Beach into a miniaturized "Manhattan on the beach."</p><p><i>Beyond the Architect's Eye</i> is a groundbreaking study that melds histories of American art, cities, and architecture with visual studies of landscape, photography, and cultural geography.</p></p><p>Mary N. Woods is Professor of the History of Architecture and Urbanism at Cornell University. She is the author of From Craft to Profession: The Practice of Architecture in Nineteenth-Century America.<p>"An intensely informed and elegant work of seminal scholarship."&#x2014;<i>The Midwest Book Review</i></p><br><br><p>"A ground-breaking study, handsomely produced and lavishly illustrated."&#x2014;<i>Journal of the Society of Architectual Historians</i></p><br><br><p>"The main contribution of this book lies in the author's wonderful descriptive passages, which are attuned to the particular details of the photographs.

After much hesitation on his part the author was persuaded, and appointed, by the Board of Directors of the Genealogical Society of Utah, to undertake such a work.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p> <p>The principles of the Gospel do not change. In connection with the lessons previously published, doctrines of the Church have been considered. This present text is not an attempt to give to the saints something new. The ordinances of baptism, laying on of hands, ordination, etc., are the same today as they have been through all generations since the beginning of time. Yet it is a fact, as every Latter-day Saint can say, that these principles which never change are in another sense always new. All who delight in the keeping of the commandments of the Lord are made to rejoice in every discussion of these principles. They never tire of hearing them. Yet old and familiar subjects may be dressed in new clothes; they need not always be presented in the self-same way; and it is always the application of Gospel truths in human lives which gives them their vital significance. It is hoped that the study and discussion of the principles here presented will inspire Latter-day Saints to be awake to their privileges and duties, to live more worthy lives, and to be more valiant in the service of God.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p> <p>This book has been prepared not only for study by genealogical workers, but for general use throughout the Church.</p></p><p></p><h2>Ireland</h2><p>The Horrible History of Ireland tells you about centuries of dreadful deeds, from cruel Celtic chieftains and suffering saints to the troubled 20th century.

Among them is the most mysterious of all, Phantom, a rarely seen mare that eludes all efforts to capture her--that is, until a young boy and girl lay eyes on her and determine that they can't live without her. The frenzied roundup that follows on the next "Pony Penning Day" does indeed bring Phantom into their lives, in a way they never would have suspected. Phantom would forever be a creature of the wild. But her gentle, loyal colt Misty is another story altogether. <p> Marguerite Henry's Newbery Honor Book has captivated generations of boys and girls both with its thrilling descriptions of true incidents from the tiny island of Chincoteague, and its realistic yet wonderfully magical atmosphere. This story of an animal brought into captivity poignantly reveals the powerful opposing forces of humans and nature. Wesley Dennis's pen-and-ink ponies are masterfully depicted with rippling muscles, shaggy coats, and free spirits. (Ages 9 to 12) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i></p>Nobody could capture the Phantom. She was the wildest mare on Assateague Island. They said she was like the wind, that the white "map" on her shoulders was her mark of freedom. <p> Paul and Maureen Beebe had their hearts set on owning her. They were itching to buy and tame her; and worked hard to earn the money she would cost. But the roundup men had tried to capture her and for two years she had escaped them.... </p><p> Pony Penning Day holds a surprise for everyone, for Paul not only brings in the Phantom, but her newborn colt as well.

Starting with the basics, the book gives a survey of the range of containers available and the plants best suited to container gardening. The heart of the book is a catalogue of planting projects for every conceivable type of container. Throughout, photo-essays give ideas for enhancing different parts of the garden with a wellchosen container arrangement.</p><p>Containing plants in boxes, baskets, and pots greatly expands a gardener's opportunities. Plant species requiring different soil compositions can be grouped in one location. Patios, roofs, stairways, and troublesome, empty spaces in the traditional garden can be transformed instantly with color, texture, and form. These two new books, both magnificiently illustrated with color photographs, demonstrate the versatility and challenges offered by container gardening. Tarling presents practical suggestions on selection and preparation of containers and shares her considerable knowledge of plant species that can best be adapted to the limitations of a contained environment. In a section devoted to various garden "situations," Tarling demonstrates the potential for plants in paved areas, balconies, steps, and window sills. Valuable botanical and artistic recommendations abound, and an appendix of key plants with descriptive notes should guide both the experienced and novice gardener. Hillier, author of The Book of Container Gardening (S. &amp; S. 1991), has prepared a unique catalog of designs for containers with details on type and size of container and type and number of plants to be used. Hillier also discusses the elements of design, the mechanics of container preparation, and methods of enhancing special areas such as steps and walls. Hillier's book, with its ready-made designs, may have a slight advantage for the novice. Both books, however, are commendable for their artistic vision and practical gardening advice.?Laurie Bartolini, Legislative Research Unit, Springfield, Ill.<br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.For the gardener buying only one book on container planting this season, this delectable, concise volume is the choice.Starting with spring, British florist and writer Hillier (Container Gardening; The Book of Fresh Flowers) offers an irresistible selection of container plantings for all four seasons. Initially considering containers, he confesses a partiality to patinas, irregularities, moss and lichen and even suggests brushing new terracotta with yogurt to speed the aging process. Discussing plant selections, he examines light, soil and moisture requirements and offers valuable tips about shape, proportion, texture and color effects. Best of all are the sparkling, one-per-page planting suggestions in the main chapters. The sizes of the container alone and with mature plantings are given; components are labeled in Latin and popular nomenclature, with the number of plants required noted. Sun, soil and watering needs are listed, along with planting instructions and suggestions for feeding and long-term care. Encouraging the use of dwarf trees and shrubs, Hillier also delivers precise reader-friendly instructions meant to cover all issues, even advising that a fuchsia standard is likely to take two years of training before it flowers. Brief annotated plant listings round out this stellar, unfussy volume. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>What Is This Thing Called Science: An Assessment of the Nature and Status of Science and Its Methods</h2><p>Book by A F Chalmers</p><p>Alan Chalmers was born in Bristol, England and has a BSc in physics from the University of Bristol, an MSc in physics from the University of Manchester and a PhD in History and Philosophy of Science from the University of London.

Yet, nearly twenty years later, inclusion is still largely an illusion for many working-class and poor Chicanas and Chicanos, since business interests continue to set the city's political and economic priorities.</p><p>In this book, Rodolfo Rosales offers the first in-depth history of the Chicano community's struggle for inclusion in the political life of San Antonio during the years 1951 to 1991, drawn from interviews with key participants as well as archival research. He focuses on the political and organizational activities of the Chicano middle class in the context of post-World War II municipal reform and how it led ultimately to independent political representation for the Chicano community. Of special interest is his extended discussion of the role of Chicana middle-class women as they gained greater political visibility in the 1980s.</p></p><p>Rodolfo Rosales is Associate Professor of Social and Policy Sciences at the University of Texas at San Antonio.&#34;Imaginative and rich political science.... Rosales&#39; analysis of middle-class Chicano activism in the early postwar era is both a new and an important contribution to our knowledge of San Antonio&#39;s and Texas&#39; recent political history.... Also, the clarity of the book&#39;s writing and structure make it a good candidate for use in intermediate undergraduate urban and/or minority politics classes.&#34; (Sidney Plotkin, Professor and Chair of Political Science, Vassar College)</p><h2>WWE: The Ultimate Poster Collection: 40 Removable Posters (Insights Poster Collections)</h2><p>Bring home the electrifying action of professional wrestling with WWE: The Ultimate Poster Collection, which features your favorite larger-than-life Superstars from over fifty years of sports-entertainment history.

Tour.</p><p>Joan Hess, winner of the American Mystery Award, is the author of eleven previous Claire Malloy mysteries, as well as ten novels in the Maggody series. Currently president of the American Crime Writers League, she lives in Arkansas.Hess's trademark humor shines in her ninth mystery (after Poisoned Pins ) to feature Claire Malloy, bookstore owner in Farberville, Ark. Claire's friend Luanne is having an affair with dentist Dick Cissel, a possible suspect in the recent death of his second wife. Luanne, who hopes Claire will investigate and turn up a more likely suspect, overcomes her friend's reluctance by finding a needed summer job for Claire's daughter Caron--at a bird sanctuary run by the Dunling Foundation. Claire's doubts about Dick's innocence increase when she learns that his first wife drowned during a midnight swim--in the same lake where the second wife was blown to smithereens while driving the damaged Dunling Foundation boat. Captain Gannett, the local sheriff, shares Claire's doubts but resents her meddling in his investigation. Claire continues her probe, spurred on by the murder of the handyman in charge of the Foundation's boat, and is thrown in jail by Gannett for withholding evidence. Rescued, to her chagrin, by her policeman lover Peter, she resolves to get to the bottom of the mysterious deaths by herself and ferrets out an unexpected scam and a follow-up conspiracy.

The quality of Tom Hollander's performance, however, renders such help unnecessary. Hollander's vocal suggestiveness, grasp of tone, and overall emotional resonance with the novel give listeners amazing clarity (especially if, like this reviewer, they've previously read the book relying on the glossary). You listen to Alex's adventures, amazed at the clarity Hollander gives to such a verbally ambitious work. This recording also includes the last chapter of the novel (not published in the first American edition), Burgess's later introduction to the book, and, from the Caedmon archives, Burgess himself reading excerpts.

Beautifully designed, the book is elaborately photographed and divided into seventeen chapters that follow the life of a wild stallion, just one of hundreds of horses that have roamed wild in the Rocky Mountains for two hundred years. The book begins with the author and filmmaker witnessing the birth of a helpless white colt, that will soon capture her heart and imagination. Each subsequent chapter documents Cloud&#x2019;s interaction with his mare Raven, his brother Diamond, and other colts in the wild as well as his adventures encountering dangerous predators, older stallions, and human trappers. The author follows Cloud over the course of five years, taking note of his physical and behavioral development, as his begins to take on more of a leadership role in the band of wild bachelors he&#x2019;s joined, to become a fighter, a survivor, and a father. Kathrens&#x2019;s emotional involvement in Cloud&#x2019;s story is palpable, such as when she tearfully watches the young stallion get captured by trappers. Due to his unusual coloration, he is set free, though the other members of his band and sisters are removed and sold. Returning to the mountains every season, the author continues to look for Cloud in the vast wild habitat, always relieved to find him still living, despite fights, predators, and encounters with trappers. She is later is touched to see how Cloud, the five-year-old mare, grazes with his yearling son, the first of his new family. Kathrens&#x2019;s gripping observations of wild horses of the Arrowheads, their fights, struggles, and alliances, give the reader much insight into the fascinating behavior of these wild horses.<br></p><p>"Cloud: Wild Stallion of the Rockies will appeal to teenage girls everywhere who love horses and want to know everything about them. The book shows readers what life is truly like for the wild Mustang and its plight." - Moira C. Harris, Editor, Horse Illustrated <p>This companion book to the one-hour television documentary of the same name premiering on PBS's NATURE series is based on the magical true story of a wild stallion growing up in the Rockies. </p><p>Wild horses. Symbols of freedom and mystery. But not until Ginger Kathrens ventured into an isolated corner of the Rocky Mountains have we had the opportunity for such an intimate glimpse into the private lives of these magnificent animals. Their story unfolds as we follow Cloud, the remarkable light-colored horse, from fragile newborn foal to five-year-old stallion. We find out how family bands are formed, how foals learn the rules of wild horse society, how bachelors fight to try to win mares, and how stallions protect their families. The drama comes alive with Ginger's words and photographs. We come to know the horses as if they were our friends. Breathtaking scenery, rugged terrain, and unpredictable weather remind us of how harsh yet fulfilling life can be for the wild horses. Find out what happens when Cloud is captured in a government roundup and where he disappears to every winter. Can Cloud win a mare so he can start his own band and follow in the footsteps of his father, Raven ? Written and photographed by Ginger Kathrens, who is also the producer and cinematographer of the NATURE documentary of the same title, Cloud: Wild Stallion of the Rockies is sure to be a winner with anyone who is lured by the majesty and spirit of the wild horse.</p>Ginger Kathrens is an Emmy-winning TV documentary producer and president of Taurus Productions, a corporation she founded in the 1970s.

From that point onward, Speer rose through the ranks ultimately becoming the second most important man in the Reich. As an individual, Speer was not politically inclined toward any faction and acted only when it appeared his own work was being threatened. As a result, Speer was able to observe the inner circle of Hitler&#39;s Nazi elite in an objective and sometimes harsh light. From the drug addict Goering to the eccentric Hess - he paints a picture of this inner circle that reveals a group interested only in serving self- interests with fighting the war nothing more than a means to an end. Dust jacket is not price clipped but is in poor condition with yellowing at edges, chipping, tears, rubbing and scuffing. Book is in Very Good condition - there is a slight separation between the binding and top of spine; but pages are clean with not underlining; front and back end papers and pastedowns contain photos of the notes written by the author while serving time for his war crimes. Book is covered with black cloth and title, author and publishing company in gilt letters on spine; 596 pages; B/w photos of author, Hitler and other players.</p><p>From 1946 to 1966, while serving the prison sentence handed down from the Nuremburg War Crimes tribunal, Albert Speer penned 1,200 manuscript pages of personal memoirs. Titled <i>Erinnerungen</i> ("Recollections") upon their 1969 publication in German, Speer's critically acclaimed personal history was translated into English and published one year later as <i>Inside the Third Reich</i>. Long after their initial publication, Speer's memoir continues to provide one of the most detailed and fascinating portrayals of life within Hitler's inner circles, the rise and fall of the third German empire, and of Hitler himself.<p> Speer chronicles his entire life, but the majority of <i>Inside the Third Reich</i> focuses on the years between 1933 and 1945, when Speer figured prominently in Hitler's government and the German war effort as Inspector General of Buildings for the Renovation of the Federal Capital and later as Minister of Arms and Munitions. Speer's recollections of both duties foreground the impossibility of reconciling Hitler's idealistic, imperialistic ambitions with both architectural and military reality. Throughout, <i>Inside the Third Reich</i> remains true to its author's intentions. With compelling insight, Speer reveals many of the "premises which almost inevitably led to the disasters" of the Third Reich as well as "what comes from one man's holding unrestricted power in his hands." <i>-- Bertina Loeffler</i></p>Albert Speer was Hitler&#39;s right hand man. After the war he was convicted in the Nuremberg War Crimes Trials and spent 21 years in prison during which he wrote this book.</p><h2>The Spirit of Romance</h2><p>Written in 1910 when Pound was only 25 years old, and later revised by the author, this critical work has long stood as an important stage in the development of Pound&#39;s poetics, and a dramatic revaluation of Europe&#39;s literary tradition.

With the noble dwarf Tagwen and the prodigal elven princess Khyber Elessedil by his side&#x2013;and with the outcome of the bloody war between the Federation and the Free-born at stake&#x2013;Pen has accepted his mission without question. But not without risk . . . or sacrifice.<br><br> Because Shadea a&#x2019;Ru, the ruthless Druid responsible for imprisoning the true Ard Rhys and usurping leadership at Paranor, has sent her agents and assassins in relentless pursuit of Pen and his comrades. And in securing the talisman he needs to breach the Forbidding, Pen has paid a devastating price. Now if the Free-born forces&#x2013;already decimated by the Federation&#x2019;s death-dealing new weapon&#x2013;should fall, Shadea&#x2019;s domination of the Four Lands will be assured. Nothing short of Pen&#x2019;s success can turn the tide. <br><br> But Pen&#x2019;s challenge grows greater when he learns that his parents, Bek Ohmsford and Rue Meridian, have fallen into Shadea&#x2019; s hands. He must try to help them&#x2013;but once within the walls of Druid&#x2019;s Keep, where Shadea&#x2019;s minions and dark magic lurk at every turn, Pen&#x2019;s survival is far from assured. Yet it will all pale in comparison to the horrors that wait inside the Forbidding&#x2013;horrors poised to break free upon the Four Lands when the time is right. . . .</p><p>More than a quarter of a century after "The Sword of Shannara carved out its place in the pantheon of great epic fantasy, the magic of Terry Brooks's "New York Times bestselling saga burns as brightly as ever. Three complete series have chronicled the ever-unfolding history of Shannara. But more stories are still to be told--and new adventures have yet to be undertaken. Book One of High Druid of Shannara invites both the faithful longtime reader and the curious newcomer to take the first step on the next extraordinary quest. <br>Twenty years have passed since Grianne Ohmsford denounced her former life as the dreaded Ilse Witch--saved by the love of her brother, the magic of the Sword of Shannara, and the destruction of her evil mentor, the Morgawr. Now, fulfilling the destiny predicted for her, she has established the Third Druid Council, and dedicated herself to its goals of peace, harmony among the races, and defense of the Four Lands. But the political intrigue, secret treachery, and sinister deeds that have haunted Druid history for generations continue to thrive. And despite her devotion to the greater good as Ard Rhys--the High Druid of Paranor, Grianne still has bitter enemies. <br>Among the highest ranks of the Council she leads lurk those who cannot forget her reign of terror as the Ilse Witch, who covet her seat of power, and who will stop at nothing to see her deposed . . . or destroyed. Even Grianne's few allies--chief among them her trusted servant Tagwen--know of the plots against her. But they could never anticipate the sudden, ominous disappearance of the Ard Rhys, in the dead of night and without a trace. Now, barely a step ahead of the dark forces bent on stopping him, Tagwen joins Grianne's brave young nephew, Pen Ohmsford, and the wise, powerful elf Ahren Elessedil on a desperate and dangerous mission of search and rescue--to deliver the High Druid of Shannara from an unspeakable fate. <br>Expect no end of wonders, no shortage of adventure, exhilaration, suspense, and enchantment, as Terry Brooks demonstrates, once again, that there is no end to his magic of invention and mastery of storytelling. <p>"From the Hardcover edition.</p><b>Terry Brooks</b>&nbsp;has thrilled readers for decades with his powers of imagination and storytelling.

The book's most rewarding passages examine aspects of Chinese history and culture, showing an acute appreciation of the Chinese worldview and its traditional expressions. The author's analysis of contemporary China, recounting abuses of the Communist regime (particularly during the Cultural Revolution), analyzing its major figures and projecting its future, is informed and articulate.

Kennedy&#x2019;s assassination, Robert Kennedy&#x2014;formerly Jack&#x2019;s no-holds-barred political warrior&#x2014;had almost lost hope. He was haunted by his brother&#x2019;s murder, and by the nation&#x2019;s seeming inabilities to solve its problems of race, poverty, and the war in Vietnam. Bobby sensed the country&#x2019;s pain, and when he announced that he was running for president, the country united behind his hopes. Over the action-packed eighty-two days of his campaign, Americans were inspired by Kennedy&#x2019;s promise to lead them toward a better time. </p><p>With new research, interviews, and an intimate sense of Kennedy, <i>The Last Campaign</i> goes right to the heart of America&#x2019;s deepest despairs&#x2014;and most fiercely held dreams&#x2014;and tells us more than we had understood before about this complicated man and the heightened personal, racial, political, and national dramas of his times. </p></p><p><p><b>Amazon Best of the Month, June 2008</b>: When Senator Robert F. Kennedy entered the presidential race during the chaotic year of 1968, anarchy appeared to be gathering on the horizon. America was coming to grips with an unwinnable war in Vietnam and unacceptable social policies at home. <i>The Last Campaign</i> examines Kennedy's bold (and tragically shortened) efforts to awaken his country's social conscience and moral sensibility. In contrast to the cocksure attitude of <i>Thirteen Days</i> (RFK's own 1962 memoir of the Cuban Missile Crisis), Thurston Clarke reveals a very human politician who often trembled at the podium and scanned crowds for an assassin's glare. Though motivated to serve by an unwavering desire to help the poor and oppressed, Kennedy also lived with a deep fear that his life would be cut short by violence. "I'm afraid there are guns between me and the White House," he prophetically remarked during the spring of '68. Yet <i>The Last Campaign</i> chooses not to explore what could have been. Instead, Clarke focuses on what is certain: for an 82-day period, Kennedy "convinced millions of Americans that he was a good man, perhaps a great man." <i>--Dave Callanan</i> </p> <p><strong>Exclusive Q&amp;A with Author Thurston Clarke</strong> </p> <p> </p><table> <tbody><tr> <td> <table> <tbody><tr> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> Kennedy during a 1967 visit to the Mississippi Delta where he found children starving in windowless shacks.</td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> Attorney General Robert F.

But I think Bobby Kennedy continues to be relevant because he tackled issues such as race, poverty, and an ill-advised and unpopular war that remain relevant. And not only did he address these issues but he addressed them with an honesty and passion that no other president or politician has equaled since 1968. </p> <p> <b>Amazon.com:</b> Despite his own fears, Kennedy made himself dangerously accessible to crowds. Was this an act of defiance or conviction? </p> <p> <b>Clarke:</b> It was both defiance and conviction. </p> <p> Speaking of President Johnson&#x2019;s bubble-topped, bulletproof limousine, he told a reporter, "I&#x2019;ll tell you one thing: if I&#x2019;m elected President, you won&#x2019;t find me riding around in any of those God-damned cars. We can&#x2019;t have that kind of country, where the President is afraid to go among the people." When his aides (who were worried about his safety throughout the campaign) urged him to spend more time campaigning from television studios and less time plunging into crowds, he told them, "There are so many people who hate me that I&#x2019;ve got to let the people who love me see me." Kennedy also knew that crowds revived him&#x2013;"like a couple of drinks," according to aide Fred Dutton&#x2013;and that letting people see him in person was the best way to prove that his reputation for being "ruthless" was unmerited. </p> <p> <b>Amazon.com:</b> Hypothetical questions achingly surround Bobby Kennedy and his legacy. Did any single "What if?" occupy your thoughts as you researched this book? Kennedy campaigning in Los Angeles during 1968 </p> <p> <b>Clarke:</b> Several "What ifs" haunted me. </p> <p> Kennedy had wanted to avoid going to the Ambassador Hotel on the evening of June 4, 1968 and instead watch the returns at the home of John Frankenheimer. The networks, however, protested that they needed him at the hotel for interviews and wanted to cover the victory celebration live if he won. Kennedy caved in and went to the hotel. </p> <p> Kennedy always went through the crowd in a ballroom or auditorium after speaking, and became angry with aides who tried to hustle him out a back door. But on the night of his assassination, he broke his own rule and went through the hotel pantry where Sirhan Sirhan was waiting. </p> <p> And what if he had won the nomination and become president? I doubt that there would have been riots at the Democratic convention in Chicago that year -- riots that helped elect Richard Nixon to the presidency and that have proven to be an albatross around the neck of Democrats for forty years. A President Robert Kennedy would have withdrawn America from Vietnam soon and there would be fewer names on the Vietnam wall. There would have been no bombing of Cambodia, Kent State, or Watergate, and so on, and so on. </p> <p> <b>Amazon.com:</b> Kennedy's campaign strategy was fraught with risk, as one observer remarked that "he kept hammering away at the plight of the poor when there was more chance for political loss than gain." Had Bobby simply had enough with politics as usual? </p> <p> <b>Clarke:</b> Kennedy&#x2019;s obsession with the plight of America&#x2019;s poor was more the result of his own personal experiences than any rejection of politics as usual. He had held a starving child in his arms in Mississippi. He had visited the appalling schools on Indian reservations where students learned nothing about their own culture and history. He had tramped through tenements in Brooklyn and come upon a girl whose face had been disfigured by rat bites. He believed that he had a responsibility to educate the American people about these conditions. </p> <p> During a flight on his chartered campaign plane he told Sylvia Wright of Life magazine, ". . . for every two or three days that you waste time making speeches at rallies full of noise and balloons, there&#x2019;s usually a chance every two or three days . . . where you get a chance to teach people something; and to tell them something that they don&#x2019;t know because they don&#x2019;t have the chance to get around like I do, to take them some place vicariously that they haven&#x2019;t been, to show them a ghetto, or an Indian reservation." And it was moments like these, Kennedy told Wright, that made a political campaign, despite all its banalities and indignities, "worth it." </p> <p> <b>Amazon.com:</b> In your opinion, will we ever see another Bobby Kennedy? Have we become too jaded to embrace a candidate like RFK or has campaigning simply become political theater? </p> <p> <b>Clarke:</b> One of the aides who scheduled many of Kennedy&#x2019;s appearances that spring, told me, "What he did was not really that mystical. All it requires is someone who knows himself, and has some courage." </p>After John Kennedy's assassination, Robert&#x2014;formerly his brother's no-holds-barred political warrior&#x2014;was left stunned and grieving. He was haunted by his brother&#x2019;s murder and by the nation's failure to address its most pressing challenges&#x2014;race, poverty, and the war in Vietnam. When he announced that he was running for president, much of the country was thrilled to hear his message of healing and hope. Although fearing that there were, as he told one confident, "guns between me and the White House," he risked his life to ask Americans to help him reclaim "the generous impulses that are the soul of this nation." <br> <br>Kennedy stirred huge crowds, who would often tear his clothes, and moved even the most hard-bitten of journalists and other intimate observers. After spending most of the campaign at Kennedy&#x2019;s side, reporter Richard Harwood, a former marine who had initially been suspicious of Kennedy, asked his editors at the <i>Washington Post</i> to replace him, telling them, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m falling in love with the guy.&#x201d; <br> <br>Four days after Robert Kennedy was assassinated, two million grieving Americans lined the tracks to watch his funeral train carry his body from New York to Washington. In <i>The Last Campaign</i>, Thurston Clarke explains how one man could have this effect on so many people. <br> <br> <br></p><h2>The Message: Job: Led by Suffering to the Heart of God</h2><p>Written in the frank, everyday language we use today, Job allows readers to ask the difficult questions that arise when life doesn&#39;t turn out exactly the way it has been planned. Like Job, readers will realize that it isn&#39;t easy answers or complex formula</p><p>EUGENE H. PETERSON is a writer and poet. He has authored more than twenty books and is a contributing editor to Leadership Journal. He is Professor Emeritus of Spiritual Theology at Regent College in Vancouver, British Columbia. Eugene was also the founding pastor of Christ Our King Presbyterian Church in Bel Air, Maryland, where he ministered for twenty-nine years.Life can be terribly precarious. Just when everything seems to be going well, we find ourselves sick in the hospital, mourning the loss of a loved one, dismissed from a job, stunned by a broken relationship, or depressed and bewildered by circumstances beyond our comprehension. Invariably, people show up to tell us exactly where we went wrong and what we must do to get better. Job was no exception. in the midst of his pain, his friends arrived with their advice. Although some of what they said was true, the answers they gave were impersonal, lacking in intimacy -- and fell far short of the wisdom Job desperately needed. Job rejected their easy answers and longed instead for an answer straight from God. Eugene Peterson brings the same passionate, honest, insightful language to one of the most familiar (and troubling) books of the Bible. Much more than just a story of pain and suffering, the book of Job probes the depths of human struggle -- a struggle that involves wrestling with the very nature of God. Written in the frank, everyday language we use today, Peterson's rendition of "Job" invites us to ask the difficult questions that arise when life seems to be spinning out of control. And with Job, we realize that simple solutions or complex formulas to the mysteries of life aren't really what we want. What we really want and need is the relief and comfort that comes from God himself, speaking to us out of the whirlwind. -- <i>Midwest Book Review</i></p><h2>Sailing Legends: Volvo Ocean Race</h2><p>Sailing Legends recounts the stories and heroes of the longest running ocean race.

His view is diminished by light pollution, making it hard to see much of anything in the sky. Our fast-paced, technologically advanced society, he concludes, is not conducive to stargazing or soul-searching. Taking a page from Thoreau's <i>Walden</i>, he decides to get away from the clamor of everyday life, journeying alone through California's Channel Islands National Park. There, he imagines, he might be able to "breathe slowly and think clearly, to examine how we live and what we live for." <br><br>In between his week-long solo trips through these pristine islands, McAlpine reaches out to try to better understand his fellow man: he eats lunch with the homeless in Beverly Hills, sits in the desert with a 98-year-old Benedictine monk, and befriends a sidewalk celebrity impersonator in Hollywood. What he discovers about himself and the world we live in will inspire anyone who wishes they had the time to slow down and notice the wonders of nature and humanity.</p><p>Ken McAlpine is the author of ten books;fiction, non-fiction and selected essays. Of his novel TOGETHER WE JUMP, USA TODAY said, "There's a beautiful Forrest Gump feel to this book. The main character was a delight, and I just loved his sad, wistful, wonderful tale." His non-fiction work OFF SEASON: DISCOVERING AMERICA ON WINTER'S SHORE was a Barnes and Noble Discover Great New Writers selection. He is currently finishing the last book in a three-book series (JUNCTURE, NEXUS, DEPARTURE), a tale part cerebral JAWS, part TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA and part warning. <br><br>Most important, Ken lives in Ventura, California with his wife and their two sons.He likes to stand in his yard at night looking at the stars, but he does not like to spend any time during the day doing yard work. For more information,please see kenmcalpine.comI visited the Channel Islands in no particular order, for they all offer solitude and so, in these chaotic times, a chance to see things more clearly. It&#x2019;s true, some of the islands offer more opportunity for quiet reflection than others. Mostly, this is a matter of distance. Anacapa Island, only eleven miles off the southern California mainland, is the most visited. (Americans like efficiency: Anacapa can be wrapped up in half a day; boat out, traipse about the island, and be home in time for <i>Oprah.</i>) <br>But as the Channel Islands edge farther into the Pacific, the degree of convenience falls off and, not surprisingly, so does the number of visitors. Fog-bound, wind-swept, and weather-scoured, Santa Rosa&#x2019;s remote attitude whispered alluringly. It seemed as good a place as any to start reflecting. <br>And so, on a sunny April morning, Dwight Willey, captain of the National Park Service&#x2019;s hundred-foot Ocean Ranger, stood inside the cabin, giving a safety talk before the vessel left Ventura Harbor.<br>&#x201c;Big swell today,&#x201d; said Dwight. He had the easy smile of an accomplished seaman, or someone quite comfortable with the prospect of a long swim. &#x201c;Make sure you hang on to something when you&#x2019;re moving around the boat. If you&#x2019;re feeling a little under the weather, grab a trash can, don&#x2019;t go to the rail.&#x201d; Dwight held up a life vest. &#x201c;Everybody seen these before?&#x201d; Just as quickly, he stashed it away. &#x201c;Hope you never have to see them again.&#x201d;<br>Finished with his briefing, Dwight announced, &#x201c;Just talked to Earl out there. He said it&#x2019;s bikini weather.&#x201d;<br>Mark Senning, Santa Rosa&#x2019;s head ranger, nodded to Dwight, but he smiled at me. &#x201c;The weather&#x2019;s good now, but things change fast out there,&#x201d; Mark said. &#x201c;If you&#x2019;d gone out last week it would have been, well I won&#x2019;t say miserable, but it would have been challenging for you. It was the way Santa Rosa is typically in the springtime. It blows like hell.&#x201d;<br>I had neglected to pack a bikini, but other than that I felt reasonably prepared. I had garnered much of my information from Channel Island National Park&#x2019;s very own website.<br>From across the table, Mark smiled again. <br>&#x201c;People can visit the website, they can read all the materials, but they still don&#x2019;t understand what they&#x2019;re getting into,&#x201d; he said.<br>&#x2014;</p><h2>Promised Lands: A Novel of the Texas Reb</h2><p>While Dr. Hugh Kenner and his sons, Miles and Toby, members of a militia of farmers and fortune seekers under Sam Houston, prepare to fight Santa Anna&#39;s army, they are unaware that their beloved home has been destroyed</p><p>An engaging historical, by Crook (The Raven's Bride, 1991), that deftly deflates myths about the Texas fight (1835-36) for independence from Mexico, revealing the desperation, poor planning, and grandiose leadership on both sides--and the carnage that resulted. As the story begins, hot-tempered young Miles Kenner, a homesteader in Texas, Mexico, leaves home to join the mostly Anglo rebels fortifying San Antonio's Alamo. Miles's father, Hugh, soon heads to the front as well; a doctor, he's needed to tend to the ragged ranks of wounded rebels. The younger Kenner son, Toby, goes along with Hugh, while the Kenner women--Hugh's elderly mother; his wife, Rose; and their daughter, Katie--join a long line of refugees. At the same time, Adelaido Pacheco, a Texan of Mexican ancestry, and his sister Crucita find themselves caught in the middle. True Tejanos, they move easily between the Anglo and Mexican worlds but are wholly at home in neither. Meanwhile, the Kenner refugees brave hunger, cold, illness, cottonmouths, and terrifying rumors only to lose Hugh's mother, and the Kenner men are caught in a bloody debacle at Goliad that ends when the surviving rebels surrender. Conscripted to doctor Mexican soldiers, Hugh is at work when Miles is killed in a gory Palm Sunday massacre, from which Toby escapes. Toby sets out alone, trekking for days before finding a rebel camp. Brutalized, half-starved, and seriously wounded, he is barely recognizable when Hugh finds him three weeks later, just after the battle of San Jacinto. In this battle, the one that wins the war for Texas, bloodthirsty rebels descend on General Santa Anna's army--and Crucita is killed. After the war, the Kenners return to their homestead while Adelaido heads west--and, perhaps, into another installment in Crook's series. Convincing characters and vivid description bring a fascinating period to life. Cook hits a flat note on occasion, but too rarely to spoil the harmony. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Readers of Crook's second historical novel (after The Raven's Bride ) will probably remember most vividly the sheer bodily pain and discomfort, described in often sickening detail, experienced by all of the characters presented here. In this absorbing narrative, Crook tells of two families, one American and one Mexican, involved in the Texas Rebellion of 1836; their lives become politically and emotionally related. Crook's careful research results in a vivid and unsparing portrait of the physical and psychological horrors of the conflict. Parents are separated from children, wives from husbands, brothers from sisters; the wounded wander the land like ghosts; there is little mercy towards prisoners. Crook's prose, while suffering occasional lapses in word choice (in what is supposed to be a romantic scene between Katie and William, Crook writes that "William wormed in close to her"), is generally tough and wise (when, after Katie loses her grasp on her grandmother and the old woman slips into the river and is washed away, "Katie thought how horrible for Grand to know that the final human touch she ever had was someone letting go"). Crook conveys an almost tactile sense of life in a different time. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Interlude in Death (In Death Series)</h2><p><p>In early spring of 2059, Lieutenant Eve Dallas is called off planet to face a grueling ordeal&#x2014;giving a seminar at the largest police conference of the year, to be held in a swanky resort.

There are more than 280 million copies of her books in print.Charlie's Angels meet Thelma &amp; Louise in this sexy and futuristic murder mystery. Ladies, you'll want to hear Susan Ericksen read the last scene over and over and, mmmm, over again. Listeners of both genders will find themselves relieved when the book's capable heroine Lt. Eve Dallas comes to the end of a reckless motorcycle ride. Ericksen reads as if she wrote and lived Robb's story, yet there's a distraction to the drama. Why has the author chosen to set this mystery series in the future? Repetitive references to the year 2050 add nothing. A timeless, empowering love story doesn't need "wrist units" when "watches" will do.
